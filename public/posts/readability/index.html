<p>Wikipedia is a great resource for getting a quick overview of a topic. But sometimes the articles are too long or too technical. <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simple Wikipedia</a> helps, although it can still be pretty <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy</a> and not always simple enough. Or it might be too simple, depending on what I am trying to learn. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be able to choose the level of detail and length based on what I am looking. Sometimes when I am researching a new topic and come across 10 new terms, all linking to their own detailed Wikipedia pages, I just want to get a 50-100 word gist. Other times, I want to get a 1000-word summary of a topic I am sort of familiar with but don&rsquo;t know well enough.</p>
<p>I have this same need for other text-based content like news articles and technical documents. And I believe a solution for this would improve readability and thus improve comprehension for everyone, not just me.</p>
<h1 id="readability--comprehension">Readability &amp; Comprehension <a href="#readability--comprehension" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Readability refers to the ease with which a reader can read and understand a written text. It is influenced by factors such as sentence length, word complexity, and the structure of the text. Comprehension is the reader&rsquo;s ability to absorb and interpret the information presented in the text. The best way to explain any concept or information is to cater to the reader&rsquo;s level of understanding and prior knowledge. This can be achieved by using familiar language, breaking down complex ideas into smaller parts, and using examples or analogies that the reader can relate to.</p>

<h2 id="applications">Applications <a href="#applications" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>I think someday in the future, along with adjusting zoom-level, font-size, and color, we will have a couple of more sliders in every browser: level and length.</p>
<p>// write about where it gets rendered - cost is on the local
// write about selecting a piece of text and then selecting a level and length for explanation</p>
<h2 id="level">Level <a href="#level" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Level is reading comprehension level, from 1st grade to 12th grade, from college first year to 20yr expert in field. Level can also automatically use sensible euphemisms for younger readers to reduce the details of gore, violence, or explicit verbiage.</p>
<h2 id="length">Length <a href="#length" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Length is for specifying the number of words, from summary (50-100 words) to detailed (1000-1500 words). Length is about focusing on the core concepts of the text to best explain the material, and not just listing the &ldquo;Top 5 Things About&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="ux-preview">UX Preview <a href="#ux-preview" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>This is the current Mobile Safari Reader options panel:</p>
<figure><img src="safari-read.jpg"
         alt="Mobile Safari Readability options at present" width="390"/>
</figure>

<p>This is what I hope to see someday, not just in Safari but in every browser:</p>

<h2 id="how-this-could-work">How this could work <a href="#how-this-could-work" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>At present, <a href="https://openai.com/gpt-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT 4</a> by OpenAI is the only large language model (LLM) capable of doing an acceptable job at taking a few pages worth of text and rewriting it to a different reading comprehension level at a different length. I tried a few different cloud LLMs and a number of local LLMs, but their results were not good enough, though I&rsquo;m certain that will change with time. In fact, I am banking on it because I hope that in a few years (maybe 5-10), almost all consumer-level or above devices will have their own local LLM capable of re-explaining or rewriting any source content to best cater to the reader.</p>
<p>There should always be an option to view original source text and any altered/rewritten text should be clearly highlighted. Thankfully, we already have those types of identifying markers and warnings when translating between languages today. LLMs can perform translations within the same language to address varying comprehension levels at multiple detail lengths and the same type of warnings should be shown.</p>
<h2 id="would-this-actually-work-and-be-useful">Would this actually work and be useful? <a href="#would-this-actually-work-and-be-useful" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>I think so. And that is why I spent $500 on GPT 4 API to rewrite these 5 Wikipedia articles at different levels.</p>
