<p>Arcology is a big word that means designing buildings to fit lots of people and be good for nature. The idea was made by an architect named Paolo Soleri in 1969. He thought these buildings could have homes, shops, and farms, while also being kind to the environment. This idea is mostly in books and hasn&rsquo;t been built yet. Some cities have tried to make buildings like this, like a project in Arizona and some in Tokyo and Shanghai. There&rsquo;s even a city being built in Saudi Arabia that&rsquo;s designed to have no cars or pollution!</p>

<h1 id="arcology-a-cool-idea-for-future-cities">Arcology: A Cool Idea for Future Cities! <a href="#arcology-a-cool-idea-for-future-cities" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p><strong>What is Arcology?</strong></p>
<p>Arcology is a big word that comes from two smaller words: &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; and &ldquo;ecology&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s an idea for designing cities that can hold a lot of people but are also kind to the environment. This idea was first thought of by a man named Paolo Soleri in 1969. He imagined cities that had homes, shops, farms, and everything else people need, all in one place. This way, we wouldn&rsquo;t harm nature as much. But, we haven&rsquo;t built a real city like this yet. Some of our favorite science fiction writers, like Larry Niven and William Gibson, have written about these kinds of cities in their books.</p>
<p><strong>How Would Arcology Work?</strong></p>
<p>An arcology city would be more than just a big building. It would be designed to use its own resources, like power and water, very wisely. It would also grow its own food and clean its own waste. This way, it wouldn&rsquo;t need to take too much from nature. Arcology cities would also have their own systems for things like transportation and commerce, so they could work well with other cities. The goal is to have a lot of people living comfortably in one place without using up too much of Earth&rsquo;s resources. Some people, like Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller, had similar ideas in the past, but they didn&rsquo;t exactly call it arcology.</p>
<p><strong>Arcology in Real Life and Fiction</strong></p>
<p>There are some places in the world that are trying to be a bit like arcology cities. For example, Arcosanti in Arizona is a project that&rsquo;s been going on since 1970. It&rsquo;s trying to show how an arcology city might work. Some other cities, like Tokyo and Dongtan near Shanghai, have also tried to use arcology ideas in their design. And even though we haven&rsquo;t built a full arcology city yet, we can see them in books and video games. In the game Sim City 2000, players can build their own arcology cities!</p>

<h1 id="understanding-arcology">Understanding Arcology <a href="#understanding-arcology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Hey kids! Have you ever heard of the word &lsquo;Arcology&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s a big word, but don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re going to break it down and make it easy to understand. Arcology is a mix of two words, &lsquo;architecture&rsquo; and &rsquo;ecology&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s all about designing buildings and cities in a way that allows lots of people to live together, but without harming our beautiful planet.</p>
<h2 id="the-idea-of-arcology">The Idea of Arcology <a href="#the-idea-of-arcology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The term &lsquo;Arcology&rsquo; was first used by an architect named Paolo Soleri in 1969. He thought that an arcology, a city built with these principles, would have spaces for homes, shops, and even farms, all while reducing the harm we cause to the environment. However, no such city has been built yet.</p>
<p>The idea of arcology has been used in many science fiction books. Authors like Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, and William Gibson have written about cities where each corporation has its own self-contained city known as arcologies.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-an-arcology-work">How Does an Arcology Work? <a href="#how-does-an-arcology-work" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>An arcology is different from a large building because it&rsquo;s designed to lessen the impact of people living on the environment. It could be self-sustainable, which means it uses its own resources to provide everything people need to live comfortably. This includes power, climate control, food production, air and water conservation and purification, sewage treatment, and more.</p>
<p>Arcologies were suggested to reduce the harm we cause to natural resources. They use regular building techniques in very large projects to make it easier for people to walk or bike instead of using cars.</p>
<h2 id="early-arcology-ideas">Early Arcology Ideas <a href="#early-arcology-ideas" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Frank Lloyd Wright, a famous architect, proposed an early version of an arcology called Broadacre City. It was different from an arcology because it was spread out and depended on roads. Critics said that Wright&rsquo;s idea didn&rsquo;t consider population growth and assumed a more rigid democracy than the US has.</p>
<p>Another architect, Buckminster Fuller, proposed a domed city for 125,000 people as a solution to housing problems in East St. Louis, Illinois. Paolo Soleri, who coined the term &lsquo;arcology&rsquo;, suggested ways of compacting city structures to save on transportation and other energy uses.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-arcology-projects">Real-World Arcology Projects <a href="#real-world-arcology-projects" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Arcosanti is an experimental &lsquo;arcology prototype&rsquo; under construction in central Arizona since 1970. It&rsquo;s designed by Paolo Soleri to demonstrate his personal designs and principles of arcology to create a pedestrian-friendly city.</p>
<p>There are many cities in the world like Tokyo and Dongtan near Shanghai that have proposed projects following the design principles of the arcology concept. The Antarctic research base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly 3,000 staff who visit each year. Its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character.</p>
<h2 id="arcology-in-popular-culture">Arcology in Popular Culture <a href="#arcology-in-popular-culture" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Most attempts to build real arcologies have failed due to financial, structural, or conceptual problems. Therefore, arcologies are mostly found in fictional works. In Robert Silverberg&rsquo;s The World Inside, most of the global population of 75 billion live inside giant skyscrapers, called &ldquo;urbmons&rdquo;, each of which contains hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>In the city-building video game Sim City 2000, self-contained arcologies can be built, reducing the infrastructure needs of the city.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>So, that&rsquo;s what &lsquo;Arcology&rsquo; is all about! It&rsquo;s a cool concept that combines architecture and ecology to create cities that can house a lot of people without harming the environment. It&rsquo;s a big idea that&rsquo;s been used in many science fiction books and even in video games. Who knows, maybe one day we might see a real arcology!</p>

<p>Arcology, a concept combining architecture and ecology, aims to create densely populated, ecologically friendly habitats. This idea, first proposed by Paolo Soleri in 1969, envisions structures that house residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities while minimizing environmental impact. However, no full-scale arcology has been built yet. The concept has been popular in science fiction and some real-world projects, like Arcosanti in Arizona and the proposed &ldquo;The Line&rdquo; in Saudi Arabia, have tried to apply these principles. Arcologies aim to be self-sufficient, using their own resources for power, food, and waste treatment, and reducing the impact on natural resources.</p>

It&rsquo;s a concept that involves designing buildings for densely populated areas in a way that minimally affects the environment. The term was first used in 1969 by an architect named Paolo Soleri. He believed that an arcology could house a variety of facilities such as homes, businesses, and farms, while also reducing the environmental impact of each person living there. However, no actual arcology has been built yet, despite Soleri&rsquo;s vision. The idea of arcologies has been used by many science fiction writers, who often depict them as self-contained or economically self-sufficient cities.</p>
<h1 id="development-and-real-world-projects">Development and Real-World Projects <a href="#development-and-real-world-projects" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>An arcology is different from just a large building because it&rsquo;s designed to lessen the impact of people living on the environment. It could be self-sustainable, meaning it uses its own resources to provide for the needs of its inhabitants, such as power, climate control, food production, and water and air conservation and purification. Arcologies were proposed to reduce the use of natural resources. They might use regular building and engineering techniques on a large scale to make it easier for people to get around without cars, which is hard to do in other ways. There have been similar real-world projects, like Arcosanti, an experimental project in Arizona designed by Soleri, and proposals for arcology-like designs in cities like Tokyo and Dongtan near Shanghai.</p>

All the inhabitants&rsquo; needs are provided inside the building, so going outside is considered crazy. In the video game Sim City 2000, players can build self-contained arcologies to reduce the infrastructure needs of the city. Despite the challenges, the concept of arcology continues to inspire architects and urban planners, and it remains a fascinating idea for a sustainable future.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-arcology">Introduction to Arcology <a href="#introduction-to-arcology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Arcology is a blend of two words: &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; and &ldquo;ecology&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a unique field that merges these two disciplines to create design principles for densely populated, yet environmentally friendly human habitats. The term was first introduced in 1969 by an architect named Paolo Soleri. He envisioned that a fully realized arcology would house various residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities, all while minimizing the environmental impact of its inhabitants. However, these structures have remained mostly theoretical, with no complete arcology yet built, even by Soleri himself.</p>
<p>The concept of arcology has been widely popularized in the realm of science fiction. Authors like Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, William Gibson, Peter Hamilton, and Paolo Bacigalupi have incorporated arcologies into their narratives. In these stories, arcologies are often depicted as self-contained or economically self-sufficient entities.</p>
<h1 id="development-of-arcology">Development of Arcology <a href="#development-of-arcology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>An arcology is not just a large building. It&rsquo;s a structure designed to lessen the environmental impact of human habitation. It aims to be self-sustainable, using all or most of its resources for a comfortable life, such as power, climate control, food production, air and water conservation and purification, sewage treatment, and more. An arcology is designed to supply these necessities for a large population, maintaining its own municipal or urban infrastructures to operate and connect with other urban environments.</p>
<p>Arcologies were proposed to reduce human impact on natural resources. Arcology designs might use conventional building and civil engineering techniques on a large scale to achieve economies of scale that are difficult to achieve post-automobile.</p>
<p>Notable figures like Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller proposed early versions of arcologies. Wright&rsquo;s proposal, called Broadacre City, was criticized for not accounting for population growth and assuming a more rigid democracy than the US has. Fuller proposed a domed city project called Old Man River&rsquo;s City as a solution to housing problems in East St. Louis, Illinois.</p>
<p>Paolo Soleri, who coined the term &ldquo;arcology&rdquo;, proposed later solutions. He described ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl and economize on transportation and other energy uses. Soleri advocated for greater &ldquo;frugality&rdquo; and favored greater use of shared social resources, including public transit and public libraries.</p>
<h1 id="similar-real-world-projects">Similar Real-World Projects <a href="#similar-real-world-projects" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>While no complete arcology has been built, there have been similar projects.

<p>Several cities around the world, like Tokyo and Dongtan near Shanghai, have proposed projects that adhere to the design principles of the arcology concept. However, the Dongtan project may have collapsed and failed to open for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010.</p>
<p>McMurdo Station of the United States Antarctic Program and other scientific research stations on Antarctica resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically advanced, relatively self-sufficient human community. The Begich Towers in Whittier, Alaska, operates like a small-scale arcology, housing nearly all of the town&rsquo;s population and facilities.</p>
<p>The Line, a linear smart city under construction in Saudi Arabia, is designed to have no cars, streets, or carbon emissions. It is planned to be the first development in Neom, a $500 billion project, and anticipates a population of 9 million.</p>

<p>Arcology, a term coined by architect Paolo Soleri in 1969, is a concept that blends architecture and ecology. The idea is to create densely populated yet ecologically low-impact human habitats. These habitats, or arcologies, would house a variety of facilities, such as residential, commercial, and agricultural spaces, while minimizing individual human environmental impact. Despite the concept&rsquo;s popularity in science fiction literature, no arcology has been built yet. Authors like Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, William Gibson, Peter Hamilton, and Paolo Bacigalupi have used arcologies in their works, often portraying them as self-contained or economically self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Arcologies aim to reduce the impact of human habitation on ecosystems.

<h1 id="introduction-to-arcology-1">Introduction to Arcology <a href="#introduction-to-arcology-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Arcology is a term that merges &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; and &ldquo;ecology.&rdquo; This field focuses on creating architectural design principles that cater to very densely populated and ecologically low-impact human habitats. The term was coined in 1969 by architect Paolo Soleri, who believed that a completed arcology would provide space for a variety of residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human environmental impact. However, these structures have remained largely hypothetical, as no arcology, even one envisioned by Soleri himself, has yet been built.</p>
<p>The concept of arcology has been popularized by various science fiction writers. Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle provided a detailed description of an arcology in their 1981 novel Oath of Fealty. William Gibson mainstreamed the term in his seminal 1984 cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, where each corporation has its own self-contained city known as arcologies. More recently, authors such as Peter Hamilton in Neutronium Alchemist and Paolo Bacigalupi in The Water Knife explicitly used arcologies as part of their scenarios. They are often portrayed as self-contained or economically self-sufficient.</p>
<h1 id="development-of-arcology-1">Development of Arcology <a href="#development-of-arcology-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>An arcology is distinguished from a merely large building in that it is designed to lessen the impact of human habitation on any given ecosystem. It could be self-sustainable, employing all or most of its own available resources for a comfortable life: power, climate control, food production, air and water conservation and purification, sewage treatment, etc. An arcology is designed to make it possible to supply those items for a large population. An arcology would supply and maintain its own municipal or urban infrastructures in order to operate and connect with other urban environments apart from its own.</p>
<p>Arcologies were proposed to reduce human impact on natural resources. Arcology designs might apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large, but practical projects in order to achieve pedestrian economies of scale that have proven, post-automobile, to be difficult to achieve in other ways.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright proposed an early version called Broadacre City although, in contrast to an arcology, his idea is comparatively two-dimensional and depends on a road network. Wright&rsquo;s plan described transportation, agriculture, and commerce systems that would support an economy. Critics said that Wright&rsquo;s solution failed to account for population growth, and assumed a more rigid democracy than the US actually has.</p>
<p>Buckminster Fuller proposed the Old Man River&rsquo;s City project, a domed city with a capacity of 125,000, as a solution to the housing problems in East St. Louis, Illinois. Paolo Soleri proposed later solutions, and coined the term &ldquo;arcology&rdquo;. Soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl, to economize on transportation and other energy uses. Like Wright, Soleri proposed changes in transportation, agriculture, and commerce. Soleri explored reductions in resource consumption and duplication, land reclamation; he also proposed to eliminate most private transportation.

Designed by Paolo Soleri, its primary purpose is to demonstrate Soleri&rsquo;s personal designs, his application of principles of arcology to create a pedestrian-friendly urban form. Many cities in the world have proposed projects adhering to the design principles of the arcology concept, like Tokyo, and Dongtan near Shanghai. The Dongtan project may have collapsed, and it failed to open for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010.</p>
<p>McMurdo Station of the United States Antarctic Program and other scientific research stations on Antarctica resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically advanced, relatively self-sufficient human community. The Antarctic research base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly 3,000 staff who visit each year. Its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character. The station is not self-sufficient ‚Äì the U.S. military delivers 30,000 cubic metres (8,000,000 US gal) of fuel and 5 kilotonnes (11 million pounds) of supplies and equipment yearly through its Operation Deep Freeze resupply effort ‚Äì but it is isolated from conventional support networks. Under international treaty, it must avoid damage to the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
<p>Begich Towers operates like a small-scale arcology encompassing nearly all of the population of Whittier, Alaska. The building contains residential housing as well as a police station, grocery, and municipal offices. Whittier once boasted a second structure known as the Buckner Building. The Buckner Building still stands but was deemed unfit for habitation after the 1969 earthquake. The Line is a 170 kilometres (110 mi) long and 200 metres (660 ft) wide linear smart city under construction in Saudi Arabia in Neom, Tabuk Province, which is designed to have no cars, streets or carbon emissions. The Line is planned to be the first development in Neom, a $500 billion project. The city&rsquo;s plans anticipate a population of 9 million. Excavation work had started along the entire length of the project by October 2022.</p>
<h1 id="arcology-in-popular-culture-2">Arcology in Popular Culture <a href="#arcology-in-popular-culture-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Most proposals to build real arcologies have failed due to financial, structural or conceptual shortcomings. Arcologies are therefore found primarily in fictional works. In Robert Silverberg&rsquo;s The World Inside, most of the global population of 75 billion live inside giant skyscrapers, called &ldquo;urbmons&rdquo;, each of which contains hundreds of thousands of people. The urbmons are arranged in &ldquo;constellations&rdquo;. Each urbmon is divided into &ldquo;neighborhoods&rdquo; of 40 or so floors. All the needs of the inhabitants are provided inside the building ‚Äì food is grown outside and brought into the building ‚Äì so the idea of going outside is heretical and can be a sign of madness. The book examines human life when the population density is extremely high.</p>
<p>Another significant example is the 1981 novel Oath of Fealty by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, in which a segment of the population of Los Angeles has moved into an arcology. The plot examines the social changes that result, both inside and outside the arcology. Thus the arcology is not just a plot device but a subject of critique. In the city-building video game Sim City 2000, self-contained arcologies can be built, reducing the infrastructure needs of the city.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The concept of arcology, while largely theoretical and often seen in science fiction, represents a potential solution to many of the challenges faced by densely populated urban environments. The principles of arcology aim to create self-sustaining, ecologically friendly habitats that can support large populations with minimal impact on the environment. While no full-scale arcology has yet been built, various projects around the world have incorporated elements of the concept, demonstrating its potential for future urban planning and development.</p>

<p>Arcology, a concept combining architecture and ecology, aims to create densely populated, low-impact human habitats. Coined by architect Paolo Soleri in 1969, arcologies are designed to be self-sustainable, reducing human impact on natural resources by employing available resources for power, climate control, food production, and more. While no true arcologies have been built, various attempts and prototypes have been made, such as Arcosanti in Arizona and proposed projects in Tokyo and Shanghai. The concept has been popularized in science fiction and is often portrayed as self-contained or economically self-sufficient.</p>

Soleri envisioned arcologies as multifunctional structures that could accommodate residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human environmental impact. However, these structures remain largely hypothetical, with no completed arcology to date.</p>
<p>Arcologies aim to lessen the impact of human habitation on ecosystems by being self-sustainable and employing available resources for power, climate control, food production, air and water conservation and purification, sewage treatment, etc. They are designed to support large populations and maintain their own municipal or urban infrastructures. The concept was proposed to reduce human impact on natural resources and achieve economies of scale that are difficult to realize in post-automobile societies.</p>
<p>Prominent figures like Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller proposed early versions of arcologies. Wright&rsquo;s Broadacre City, despite being criticized for not accounting for population growth, described transportation, agriculture, and commerce systems that would support an economy. Fuller&rsquo;s Old Man River&rsquo;s City project proposed a domed city as a solution to housing problems. Soleri himself proposed compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat urban sprawl and economize on transportation and other energy uses.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-arcology-projects-and-challenges">Real-World Arcology Projects and Challenges <a href="#real-world-arcology-projects-and-challenges" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Several real-world projects have attempted to adhere to the principles of arcology. Arcosanti, an experimental &ldquo;arcology prototype&rdquo; under construction in Arizona since 1970, aims to demonstrate Soleri&rsquo;s designs and principles. Other cities like Tokyo and Dongtan near Shanghai have proposed similar projects, though the latter failed to open for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010.</p>
<p>The McMurdo Station of the United States Antarctic Program and other Antarctic research stations resemble arcologies in their insular character and advanced, relatively self-sufficient human communities. However, they are not entirely self-sufficient and rely on the U.S. military for supplies and equipment. The Begich Towers in Whittier, Alaska, operates like a small-scale arcology, while The Line, a smart city under construction in Saudi Arabia, is designed to have no cars, streets, or carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Despite these attempts, most proposals to build real arcologies have failed due to financial, structural, or conceptual shortcomings. As such, arcologies are primarily found in fictional works.</p>
<h2 id="arcology-in-popular-culture-3">Arcology in Popular Culture <a href="#arcology-in-popular-culture-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Arcologies have been popularized by various science fiction writers, who often portray them as self-contained or economically self-sufficient.

This concept was introduced in 1969 by the architect Paolo Soleri, who envisioned that a fully realized arcology would accommodate a variety of residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human environmental impact. Despite the theoretical nature of these structures, as no arcology has been constructed to date, the concept has gained popularity through various science fiction works.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-foundations-of-arcology">Theoretical Foundations of Arcology <a href="#theoretical-foundations-of-arcology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The distinguishing characteristic of an arcology, as opposed to a large building, is its design intention to lessen the impact of human habitation on any given ecosystem. An arcology could potentially be self-sustainable, utilizing all or most of its own available resources for a comfortable life, including power, climate control, food production, air and water conservation and purification, and sewage treatment. The design of an arcology is intended to make it possible to supply these items for a large population, and it would supply and maintain its own municipal or urban infrastructures in order to operate and connect with other urban environments apart from its own.</p>
<p>Arcologies were proposed as a means to reduce human impact on natural resources. Arcology designs might apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large, but practical projects to achieve pedestrian economies of scale that have proven, post-automobile, to be difficult to achieve in other ways.</p>
<h2 id="early-concepts-and-proposals">Early Concepts and Proposals <a href="#early-concepts-and-proposals" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Frank Lloyd Wright proposed an early version of an arcology called Broadacre City. However, in contrast to an arcology, his idea is comparatively two-dimensional and depends on a road network. Wright&rsquo;s plan described transportation, agriculture, and commerce systems that would support an economy. Critics argued that Wright&rsquo;s solution failed to account for population growth and assumed a more rigid democracy than the US actually has.</p>
<p>Buckminster Fuller proposed the Old Man River&rsquo;s City project, a domed city with a capacity of 125,000, as a solution to the housing problems in East St. Louis, Illinois. Paolo Soleri proposed later solutions and coined the term &ldquo;arcology&rdquo;. Soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl, to economize on transportation and other energy uses. Soleri proposed changes in transportation, agriculture, and commerce, and explored reductions in resource consumption and duplication, land reclamation; he also proposed to eliminate most private transportation. He advocated for greater &ldquo;frugality&rdquo; and favored greater use of shared social resources, including public transit (and public libraries).</p>

It&rsquo;s a series of missions to explore the Moon, just like you might explore a new playground or park. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the team behind these missions. They use special spacecrafts like orbiters, impactors, soft landers, and rovers to study the Moon. Imagine these as different types of space cars, each with its own special job!</p>
<h2 id="the-missions">The Missions <a href="#the-missions" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Chandrayaan Programme is not just one trip, but many! The first mission sent an orbiter and an impactor probe to the Moon. It&rsquo;s like throwing a ball (the impactor) from a car (the orbiter) to see what happens. They found something amazing - water on the Moon! The second mission, launched in 2019, had an orbiter, a soft lander, and a rover. It&rsquo;s like having a car, a soft cushion to land, and a little robot to explore. The lander didn&rsquo;t work as planned, but the orbiter is still studying the Moon.

These missions are led by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The programme includes different types of spacecraft like lunar orbiter, impactor, soft lander, and rover.</p>
<h2 id="programme-structure">Programme Structure <a href="#programme-structure" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Chandrayaan Programme is a multiple mission programme. This means it has many different parts. As of September 2019, one orbiter with an impactor probe has been sent to the Moon. This was done using ISRO&rsquo;s PSLV rocket. The second spacecraft, which included an orbiter, soft lander and rover, was launched on 22 July 2019. This was done using a LVM-3 rocket. There are plans for more missions in the Chandrayaan Programme, including Chandrayaan-3. The Chandrayaan-3 mission was launched in 14 July 2023 and is expected to reach the Moon&rsquo;s surface in August.</p>
<h3 id="phase-i-orbiter-and-impactor">Phase I: Orbiter and Impactor <a href="#phase-i-orbiter-and-impactor" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The first part of the Chandrayaan Programme was called Chandrayaan-1. This was announced by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on 15 August 2003. The mission was a big step forward for India&rsquo;s space program. The idea of an Indian mission to the Moon was first suggested in 1999 during a meeting of the Indian Academy of Sciences. The Astronautical Society of India took this idea forward in 2000. Soon after, ISRO set up a group called the National Lunar Mission Task Force. This group concluded that ISRO has the skills needed to carry out an Indian mission to the Moon. In April 2003, over 100 top Indian scientists in different fields discussed and approved the idea to launch an Indian probe to the Moon. Six months later, in November, the Indian government gave the go-ahead for the mission. Chandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008 aboard a PSLV-XL rocket. This mission discovered water on the Moon.</p>
<h3 id="phase-ii-soft-landers-and-rovers">Phase II: Soft landers and rovers <a href="#phase-ii-soft-landers-and-rovers" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The second part of the Chandrayaan Programme was called Chandrayaan-2. This was approved by the First Manmohan Singh Cabinet on 18 September 2008. Although ISRO was ready with the payload for Chandrayaan-2, the mission was postponed because Russia was unable to develop the lander on time. When Russia said they could not provide the lander even by 2015, India decided to develop the lunar mission independently. Chandrayaan-2 was launched on 22 July 2019 aboard a LVM3 rocket. The spacecraft was successfully put into lunar orbit on August 20, 2019. However, the lander was lost while attempting to land on 6 September 2019. The orbiter is still operational and collecting scientific data. It is expected to work for 7.5 years.</p>
<p>The next mission, Chandrayaan-3, was launched on 14 July 2023. This mission aims to show a successful and controlled landing on the lunar surface. It also intends to show the mobility of a rover on the Moon&rsquo;s terrain and to carry out scientific experiments directly on the lunar surface.</p>
<h3 id="phase-iii-on-site-sampling">Phase III: On site sampling <a href="#phase-iii-on-site-sampling" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The next mission will be the Lunar Polar Exploration Mission or Chandrayaan-4, which is suggested to be launched in 2025. India is working with Japan on this mission. This mission will be a lander-rover mission near the lunar pole to perform on site sampling and analysis of collected lunar material and demonstrate lunar night survival technologies.</p>
<p>Another mission, Chandrayaan-5, has been suggested for the time frame of 2025-30. This mission will include a lander based rotary-percussive drilling in lunar soil up to a depth of 1~1.5 meters and analysis of the soil using instruments. A volcanically and tectonically active area on the near side of the Moon will be selected for this experiment.</p>
<h3 id="phase-iv-sample-return-missions">Phase IV: Sample-return missions <a href="#phase-iv-sample-return-missions" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The last mission, Chandryaan-6, has been suggested for the time frame of 2030-35.

The second spacecraft, which consisted of an orbiter, soft lander, and rover, was launched on 22 July 2019, using a more powerful LVM-3 rocket. According to VSSC director S. Somanath, there will be a Chandrayaan-3 and more follow-up missions in the Chandrayaan Programme. The Chandrayaan-3 mission was launched on 14 July 2023 using an LVM-3 rocket and it is expected to reach the Moon&rsquo;s surface in August.</p>

The idea of an Indian scientific mission to the Moon was first discussed in 1999 during a meeting of the Indian Academy of Sciences. The Astronautical Society of India carried this idea forward in 2000. Soon after, the National Lunar Mission Task Force was set up by ISRO, which concluded that ISRO has the technical expertise to carry out an Indian mission to the Moon. In April 2003, over 100 eminent Indian scientists approved the Task Force&rsquo;s recommendation to launch an Indian probe to the Moon. Six months later, the Indian government gave the green light for the mission.</p>
<p>Chandrayaan-1, launched on 22 October 2008 aboard a PSLV-XL rocket, was a significant success for ISRO. The Moon Impact Probe, a payload on board the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, discovered water on the Moon. Apart from discovering water, the Chandrayaan-1 mission performed several other tasks such as mapping and atmospheric profiling of the Moon.</p>

Although ISRO finalised the payload for Chandrayaan-2 per schedule, the mission was postponed to 2016 because Russia was unable to develop the lander on time. When Russia cited its inability to provide the lander even by 2015, India decided to develop the lunar mission independently. Chandrayaan-2 was launched on 22 July 2019 aboard a LVM3 rocket. The spacecraft was successfully put into lunar orbit on August 20, 2019, but the lander was lost while attempting to land on 6 September 2019. The orbiter is operational, collecting scientific data, and is expected to function for 7.5 years.</p>
<p>In November 2019, ISRO officials stated that a new lunar lander mission, called Chandrayaan-3, was being studied for launch in November 2020. This mission would be a re-attempt to demonstrate the landing capabilities needed for the Lunar Polar Exploration Mission proposed in partnership with Japan for 2025. Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023. The primary goals of the Chandrayaan-3 mission were to showcase a successful and controlled touchdown on the lunar surface, demonstrate the mobility of a rover on the Moon&rsquo;s terrain, and carry out scientific experiments directly on the lunar surface.</p>

It will be a lander-rover mission near the lunar pole to perform on-site sampling and analysis of collected lunar material and demonstrate lunar night survival technologies.</p>
<p>Chandrayaan-5, suggested for the time frame of 2025-30, will include a lander-based rotary-percussive drilling in lunar soil up to a depth of 1~1.5 meters and analysis of the cut using instruments.

<p>Epistemology is like a big word for a detective kit. It helps us understand what knowledge is, where it comes from, and how we know what we know. It&rsquo;s like asking, &ldquo;How do I know that 2+2=4?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How can I be sure that my memory of yesterday&rsquo;s lunch is accurate?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a part of philosophy, which is like a big tree with many branches, and it&rsquo;s been studied by thinkers from all over the world for thousands of years. It&rsquo;s all about exploring and understanding the mystery of knowledge.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-epistemology">Understanding Epistemology <a href="#understanding-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Epistemology is a big word that sounds complicated, but it&rsquo;s actually just about understanding how we know things. It&rsquo;s like being a detective of knowledge! Epistemologists, or people who study epistemology, ask questions like &ldquo;What do people know?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How do people know that they know?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;What makes our beliefs justified?&rdquo; They also look at where our knowledge comes from, whether it&rsquo;s from what we see, what we remember, or what others tell us. They even explore if all our beliefs need to come from a solid foundation of justified beliefs, or if they just need to fit together in a way that makes sense.</p>
<h1 id="the-history-of-epistemology">The History of Epistemology <a href="#the-history-of-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The word &ldquo;epistemology&rdquo; comes from the ancient Greek word &ldquo;epistƒìmƒì,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; and the English suffix &ldquo;-ology,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;the science or discipline of.&rdquo; So, epistemology is like the science of knowledge! This idea has been around for a long time. Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle thought a lot about what people know and how they know it. Later, during the Middle Ages, philosophers like Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham also asked big questions about knowledge. Even today, philosophers continue to explore these ideas, trying to understand how our past ideas about knowledge connect to our current ones.</p>
<h1 id="key-concepts-in-epistemology">Key Concepts in Epistemology <a href="#key-concepts-in-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>In epistemology, there are a few key ideas that come up a lot. One of these is &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; which is what we&rsquo;re familiar with or understand. This could be facts, like knowing that 2 + 2 = 4, skills, like knowing how to ride a bike, or even knowing a person or a place. Another important idea is &ldquo;belief,&rdquo; which is what we think is true. For example, if you think that snow is white, that&rsquo;s a belief you have. Lastly, there&rsquo;s &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; which is when something matches up with reality. For example, the statement &ldquo;the sky is blue&rdquo; is true if the sky is actually blue. Epistemologists also talk about &ldquo;justification,&rdquo; which is having a good reason for believing something. So, if you believe that it&rsquo;s going to rain because you see dark clouds in the sky, your belief is justified because dark clouds are a good reason to think it&rsquo;s going to rain.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-epistemology-a-guide-for-kids">Understanding Epistemology: A Guide for Kids <a href="#understanding-epistemology-a-guide-for-kids" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><h2 id="what-is-epistemology">What is Epistemology? <a href="#what-is-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Have you ever asked yourself, &ldquo;How do I know what I know?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What does it mean to know something?&rdquo; These are big questions, and they&rsquo;re part of a subject called Epistemology. It&rsquo;s a big word, but don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll break it down together!</p>
<p>Epistemology comes from two Greek words: &rsquo;episteme&rsquo; which means &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;, and &rsquo;logos&rsquo; which means &lsquo;study&rsquo;. So, epistemology is the study of knowledge. It&rsquo;s a part of philosophy, which is like a big tree with many branches, like ethics (how we should behave), logic (how we should think), and metaphysics (what is real).</p>
<p>Epistemologists, the people who study epistemology, try to understand what knowledge is, where it comes from, and what it means to say we know something. They also think about how we justify our beliefs, and whether it&rsquo;s possible to know things for sure.</p>
<h2 id="where-does-epistemology-come-from">Where Does Epistemology Come From? <a href="#where-does-epistemology-come-from" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The word &rsquo;epistemology&rsquo; was first used in 1847, but the ideas it deals with are much older. Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle were already thinking about these questions. They wondered about the difference between what we know and what exists, and the conditions needed for something to be considered knowledge.</p>
<p>Later, during a time called the Hellenistic period, other philosophers focused more on epistemological questions. Some of them, like the Sceptics, even questioned whether knowledge was possible at all!</p>
<p>During the Middle Ages, philosophers like Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham also thought about these questions. And in the Islamic Golden Age, a philosopher named Al-Ghazali wrote many books about knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>In more recent times, philosophers have been divided into two groups: the empiricists, who think knowledge comes from experience, and the rationalists, who think some knowledge comes from reasoning alone. This debate is still going on today!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-key-concepts-in-epistemology">What Are Some Key Concepts in Epistemology? <a href="#what-are-some-key-concepts-in-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="knowledge">Knowledge <a href="#knowledge" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In epistemology, knowledge is often thought of as being familiar with something, understanding it, or being aware of it. This could be facts (like knowing that the earth orbits the sun), skills (like knowing how to ride a bike), or objects (like knowing your best friend).</p>
<p>Epistemologists usually focus on &lsquo;propositional knowledge&rsquo;, or knowing that something is the case. For example, knowing that &lsquo;2 + 2 = 4&rsquo; is propositional knowledge. But they also think about &lsquo;procedural knowledge&rsquo; (knowing how to do something) and &lsquo;acquaintance knowledge&rsquo; (knowing a person, place, or thing directly).</p>
<h3 id="a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge">A Priori and A Posteriori Knowledge <a href="#a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Epistemologists often talk about two types of knowledge: &lsquo;a priori&rsquo; and &lsquo;a posteriori&rsquo;. A priori knowledge is knowledge we can have without needing to experience anything. For example, you don&rsquo;t need to count two apples and two more apples to know that 2 + 2 = 4. On the other hand, a posteriori knowledge is knowledge we get from experience. For example, you know that ice is cold because you&rsquo;ve felt it before.</p>
<h3 id="belief">Belief <a href="#belief" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Belief is another important concept in epistemology. A belief is something you hold to be true. For example, if you believe that snow is white, you accept the statement &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo; as true. Beliefs can be about anything, and they play a big role in how we understand and interact with the world.</p>
<h3 id="truth">Truth <a href="#truth" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Truth is when something matches up with reality. For example, if I say &ldquo;the sky is blue&rdquo;, and the sky is indeed blue, then what I said is true. Most philosophers agree that truth is needed for knowledge. After all, if what you believe doesn&rsquo;t match up with reality, can you really say you know it?</p>
<h3 id="justification">Justification <a href="#justification" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Justification is having a good reason to believe something. If you&rsquo;re justified in believing something, it means you have good reasons for your belief. These reasons could come from your senses, from reasoning, or from someone else&rsquo;s testimony. But remember, just because you&rsquo;re justified in believing something doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s true!</p>
<h2 id="internalism-and-externalism">Internalism and Externalism <a href="#internalism-and-externalism" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Finally, let&rsquo;s talk about two different ways of thinking about justification: internalism and externalism. Internalists think that justification comes from things inside your own mind, like your thoughts and feelings. Externalists, on the other hand, think that justification can come from things outside your mind, like the world around you.</p>
<p>These are just some of the big ideas in epistemology. There&rsquo;s a lot more to explore, and lots of questions that still need answers. So, the next time you ask yourself &ldquo;how do I know what I know?&rdquo;, remember: you&rsquo;re thinking like an epistemologist!</p>

<p>Epistemology, a branch of philosophy, is the study of knowledge and belief. It explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge, as well as the conditions required for a belief to be considered knowledge. Epistemologists examine potential sources of knowledge like perception, reason, memory, and testimony. They also explore the structure of knowledge and philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility of knowledge. The term &ldquo;epistemology&rdquo; comes from the Greek word &ldquo;epistƒìmƒì,&rdquo; meaning knowledge, and the English suffix &ldquo;-ology,&rdquo; meaning the science or discipline of something. The field has been studied by philosophers throughout history, including ancient Greeks, medieval scholars, and modern thinkers.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-epistemology-1">Understanding Epistemology <a href="#understanding-epistemology-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge. It&rsquo;s like the science of knowing, helping us understand what it means to know something, how we justify our beliefs, and how we can be sure that we truly know something. For example, you might think you know that dogs are mammals because you&rsquo;ve seen dogs and they look like other mammals you know. But an epistemologist would ask, &ldquo;How do you know that what you&rsquo;ve seen is truly representative of all dogs? What makes your belief justified?&rdquo; Epistemologists often debate about what constitutes knowledge, the sources of knowledge, the structure of knowledge, and philosophical skepticism, which questions the very possibility of knowledge.</p>
<h1 id="the-origins-of-epistemology">The Origins of Epistemology <a href="#the-origins-of-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The term &ldquo;epistemology&rdquo; comes from the ancient Greek word &ldquo;epistƒìmƒì,&rdquo; which means knowledge, and the English suffix &ldquo;-ology,&rdquo; which means the science or discipline of something. It was first used in English by the Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier in the mid-19th century. The concept of epistemology, however, can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle. For example, Plato distinguished between what people know and what exists, suggesting that just because we believe something to be true doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it is. This idea was further explored by philosophers during the Hellenistic period, the Medieval period, and the Islamic Golden Age, among others. The debate between empiricists, who believe knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience, and rationalists, who think a significant portion of our knowledge is derived from reason, also played a significant role in the development of epistemology.</p>
<h1 id="key-concepts-in-epistemology-1">Key Concepts in Epistemology <a href="#key-concepts-in-epistemology-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>In epistemology, knowledge is often categorized into propositional knowledge (knowing facts), procedural knowledge (knowing how to do things), and acquaintance knowledge (knowing people, places, or things). For example, knowing that 2+2=4 is propositional knowledge, knowing how to add numbers is procedural knowledge, and knowing your best friend is acquaintance knowledge. Epistemologists also distinguish between a priori knowledge, which is known independently of experience, and a posteriori knowledge, which is known through experience.</p>
<p>Belief, truth, and justification are also central concepts in epistemology. A belief is what a person holds to be true, like believing that snow is white. Truth is being in accordance with facts or reality, like the statement &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo; being true if snow is indeed white. Justification is the reason for holding a belief, like seeing white snow as a justification for believing that snow is white. However, a belief being justified does not guarantee that it is true, as one could have good reasons for holding a false belief.</p>

It is a significant subfield of philosophy, along with other major subfields such as ethics, logic, and metaphysics.</p>
<p>Epistemologists, or those who study epistemology, delve into the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge. They are interested in understanding what constitutes justified beliefs, the rationality of belief, and various related issues. They aim to answer questions such as &ldquo;What do people know?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What does it mean to say that people know something?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What makes justified beliefs justified?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;How do people know that they know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Epistemology is often divided into four core areas of debate:</p>
<ol>
<li>The philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge, such as truth and justification.</li>
<li>Potential sources of knowledge and justified belief, such as perception, reason, memory, and testimony.</li>
<li>The structure of a body of knowledge or justified belief, including whether all justified beliefs must be derived from justified foundational beliefs or whether justification requires only a coherent set of beliefs.</li>
<li>Philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility of knowledge, and related problems, such as whether skepticism poses a threat to our ordinary knowledge claims and whether it is possible to refute skeptical arguments.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-origin-of-the-word-epistemology">The Origin of the Word &lsquo;Epistemology&rsquo; <a href="#the-origin-of-the-word-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The term &rsquo;epistemology&rsquo; comes from the ancient Greek word &rsquo;epistƒìmƒì&rsquo;, which means &ldquo;knowledge, understanding, skill, scientific knowledge&rdquo;, and the English suffix &lsquo;-ology&rsquo;, which means &ldquo;the science or discipline of (what is indicated by the first element)&rdquo;. The word &rsquo;epistemology&rsquo; first appeared in 1847, in a review in New York&rsquo;s Eclectic Magazine. Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier first used the term to present a philosophy in English in 1854. He used it as the title of the first section of his Institutes of Metaphysics, where he defined epistemology as the doctrine or theory of knowing, just as ontology is the science of being.</p>
<h2 id="historical-and-philosophical-context-of-epistemology">Historical and Philosophical Context of Epistemology <a href="#historical-and-philosophical-context-of-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The study of knowledge and its nature has been a topic of interest for philosophers since ancient times. Among the Ancient Greek philosophers, Plato distinguished between inquiry regarding what people know and inquiry regarding what exists. In his dialogue, Meno, the definition of knowledge as justified true belief appears for the first time. Aristotle also explored important epistemological concerns in his works.</p>
<p>During the Hellenistic period, philosophical schools with a greater focus on epistemological questions began to appear, often in the form of philosophical skepticism. For instance, the Hellenistic Sceptics, especially Sextus Empiricus of the Pyrrhonian school, rejected the possibility of knowledge based on Agrippa&rsquo;s trilemma. The Pyrrhonian school held that happiness could be attained through the suspension of judgment regarding all non-evident matters. The other major school of Hellenistic skepticism was Academic skepticism, defended by Carneades and Arcesilaus, which predominated in the Platonic Academy for almost two centuries.</p>
<p>In ancient India, the Aj√±ana school of ancient Indian philosophy promoted skepticism. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or to ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation.</p>
<p>Medieval philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham also engaged with epistemological questions. During the Islamic Golden Age, Al-Ghazali, a prominent and influential philosopher, theologian, jurist, logician and mystic, made significant contributions to Islamic epistemology.</p>
<p>Epistemology came to the fore in philosophy during the early modern period, which saw a dispute between empiricists, who believed that knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience, and rationalists, who believed that a significant portion of our knowledge is derived entirely from our faculty of reason. This dispute was reportedly resolved in the late 18th century by Immanuel Kant, whose transcendental idealism famously made room for the view that &ldquo;though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means follows that all [knowledge] arises out of experience&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="contemporary-historiography-of-epistemology">Contemporary Historiography of Epistemology <a href="#contemporary-historiography-of-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Contemporary scholars use different methods to understand the relationship between past epistemology and contemporary epistemology. One of the contentious questions is whether the problems of epistemology are perennial, and whether trying to reconstruct and evaluate the arguments of philosophers like Plato, Hume, or Kant is meaningful for current debates. Barry Stroud claims that doing epistemology competently requires the historical study of past attempts to find philosophical understanding of the nature and scope of human knowledge. He argues that since inquiry may progress over time, we may not realize how different the questions that contemporary epistemologists ask are from questions asked at various different points in the history of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="central-concepts-in-epistemology">Central Concepts in Epistemology <a href="#central-concepts-in-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="knowledge-1">Knowledge <a href="#knowledge-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Nearly all debates in epistemology are in some way related to knowledge. Most generally, &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, which might include facts (propositional knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge). Philosophers tend to draw an important distinction between three different senses of &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; something: &ldquo;knowing that&rdquo; (knowing the truth of propositions), &ldquo;knowing how&rdquo; (understanding how to perform certain actions), and &ldquo;knowing by acquaintance&rdquo; (directly perceiving an object, being familiar with it, or otherwise coming into contact with it). Epistemology is primarily concerned with the first of these forms of knowledge, propositional knowledge.</p>
<h4 id="a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge-1">A priori and a posteriori knowledge <a href="#a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h4><p>A key distinction in epistemology is between what can be known a priori (independently of experience) and what can be known a posteriori (through experience). A priori knowledge is knowledge that is known independently of experience, or arrived at before experience, usually by reason. A posteriori knowledge is knowledge that is known by experience, or arrived at through experience. Views that emphasize the importance of a priori knowledge are generally classified as rationalist, while views that emphasize the importance of a posteriori knowledge are generally classified as empiricist.</p>
<h3 id="belief-1">Belief <a href="#belief-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Belief is another core concept in epistemology. A belief is an attitude that a person holds regarding anything that they take to be true. For instance, to believe that snow is white is comparable to accepting the truth of the proposition &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;. Beliefs can be occurrent (a person actively thinking &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;), or they can be dispositional (a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;). While there is not universal agreement about the nature of belief, most contemporary philosophers hold the view that a disposition to express belief B qualifies as holding the belief B.</p>
<h3 id="truth-1">Truth <a href="#truth-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Truth is the property or state of being in accordance with facts or reality. On most views, truth is the correspondence of language or thought to a mind-independent world. This is called the correspondence theory of truth. Among philosophers who think that it is possible to analyze the conditions necessary for knowledge, virtually all of them accept that truth is such a condition. There is much less agreement about the extent to which a knower must know why something is true in order to know.</p>
<h3 id="justification-1">Justification <a href="#justification-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>As the term &ldquo;justification&rdquo; is used in epistemology, a belief is justified if one has good reason for holding it. Loosely speaking, justification is the reason that someone holds a rationally admissible belief, on the assumption that it is a good reason for holding it. Sources of justification might include perceptual experience (the evidence of the senses), reason, and authoritative testimony, among others. Importantly however, a belief being justified does not guarantee that the belief is true, since a person could be justified in forming beliefs based on very convincing evidence that was nonetheless deceiving.</p>
<h4 id="internalism-and-externalism-1">Internalism and externalism <a href="#internalism-and-externalism-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h4><p>A central debate about the nature of justification is a debate between epistemological externalists on the one hand and epistemological internalists on the other. While epistemic externalism first arose in attempts to overcome the Gettier problem, it has flourished in the time since as an alternative way of conceiving of epistemic justification. The initial development of epistemic externalism is often attributed to Alvin Goldman.</p>

In Meno, the definition of knowledge as justified true belief appears for the first time. In other words, belief is required to have an explanation in order to be correct, beyond just happening to be right. A number of important epistemological concerns also appeared in the works of Aristotle.</p>
<p>During the subsequent Hellenistic period, philosophical schools began to appear which had a greater focus on epistemological questions, often in the form of philosophical skepticism. For instance, the Hellenistic Sceptics, especially Sextus Empiricus of the Pyrrhonian school rejected justification on the basis of Agrippa&rsquo;s trilemma and so, in the view of Irwin (2010), rejected the  possibility of knowledge as well. The Pyrrhonian school of Pyrrho and Sextus Empiricus held that eudaimonia (flourishing, happiness, or &ldquo;the good life&rdquo;) could be attained through the application of epoch√© (suspension of judgment) regarding all non-evident matters. Pyrrhonism was particularly concerned with undermining the epistemological dogmas of Stoicism and Epicureanism. The other major school of Hellenistic skepticism was Academic skepticism, most notably defended by Carneades and Arcesilaus, which predominated in the Platonic Academy for almost two centuries.</p>
<p>In ancient India, the Aj√±ana school of ancient Indian philosophy promoted skepticism. Aj√±ana was a ≈örama·πáa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism, Jainism, and the ƒÄjƒ´vika school. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or to ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were specialized in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own.</p>
<p>After the ancient philosophical era but before the modern philosophical era, a number of Medieval philosophers also engaged with epistemological questions at length. Most notable among the Medievals for their contributions to epistemology were Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham.</p>
<p>During the Islamic Golden Age, one of the most prominent and influential philosophers, theologians, jurists, logicians, and mystics in Islamic epistemology was Al-Ghazali. During his life, he wrote over 70 books on science, Islamic reasoning, and Sufism. Al-Ghazali distributed his book The Incoherence of Philosophers, set apart as a defining moment in Islamic epistemology. He shaped a conviction that all occasions and relationships are not the result of material conjunctions but are the present and immediate will of God.</p>
<p>Epistemology largely came to the fore in philosophy during the early modern period, which historians of philosophy traditionally divide up into a dispute between empiricists (including Francis Bacon, John Locke, David Hume, and George Berkeley) and rationalists (including Ren√© Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, and Gottfried Leibniz). The debate between them has often been framed using the question of whether knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience (empiricism), or whether a significant portion of our knowledge is derived entirely from our faculty of reason (rationalism). According to some scholars, this dispute was resolved in the late 18th century by Immanuel Kant, whose transcendental idealism famously made room for the view that &ldquo;though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means follows that all [knowledge] arises out of experience&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="contemporary-historiography">Contemporary Historiography <a href="#contemporary-historiography" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>There are a number of different methods that contemporary scholars use when trying to understand the relationship between past epistemology and contemporary epistemology. One of the most contentious questions is this: &ldquo;Should we assume that the problems of epistemology are perennial, and that trying to reconstruct and evaluate Plato&rsquo;s or Hume&rsquo;s or Kant&rsquo;s arguments is meaningful for current debates, too?&rdquo; Similarly, there is also a question of whether contemporary philosophers should aim to rationally reconstruct and evaluate historical views in epistemology, or to merely describe them. Barry Stroud claims that doing epistemology competently requires the historical study of past attempts to find philosophical understanding of the nature and scope of human knowledge. He argues that since inquiry may progress over time, we may not realize how different the questions that contemporary epistemologists ask are from questions asked at various different points in the history of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="central-concepts-in-epistemology-2">Central Concepts in Epistemology <a href="#central-concepts-in-epistemology-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="knowledge-2">Knowledge <a href="#knowledge-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Nearly all debates in epistemology are in some way related to knowledge. Most generally, &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, which might include facts (propositional knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge). Philosophers tend to draw an important distinction between three different senses of &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; something: &ldquo;knowing that&rdquo; (knowing the truth of propositions), &ldquo;knowing how&rdquo; (understanding how to perform certain actions), and &ldquo;knowing by acquaintance&rdquo; (directly perceiving an object, being familiar with it, or otherwise coming into contact with it). Epistemology is primarily concerned with the first of these forms of knowledge, propositional knowledge. All three senses of &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; can be seen in our ordinary use of the word. In mathematics, you can know that 2 + 2 = 4, but there is also knowing how to add two numbers, and knowing a person (e.g., knowing other persons, or knowing oneself), place (e.g., one&rsquo;s hometown), thing (e.g., cars), or activity (e.g., addition). While these distinctions are not explicit in English, they are explicitly made in other languages, including French, Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, German and Dutch (although some languages closely related to English have been said to retain these verbs, such as Scots). The theoretical interpretation and significance of these linguistic issues remains controversial.</p>
<p>In his paper On Denoting and his later book Problems of Philosophy, Bertrand Russell brought a great deal of attention to the distinction between &ldquo;knowledge by description&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowledge by acquaintance&rdquo;. Gilbert Ryle is similarly credited with bringing more attention to the distinction between knowing how and knowing that in The Concept of Mind. In Personal Knowledge, Michael Polanyi argues for the epistemological relevance of knowledge how and knowledge that; using the example of the act of balance involved in riding a bicycle, he suggests that the theoretical knowledge of the physics involved in maintaining a state of balance cannot substitute for the practical knowledge of how to ride, and that it is important to understand how both are established and grounded. This position is essentially Ryle&rsquo;s, who argued that a failure to acknowledge the distinction between &ldquo;knowledge that&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowledge how&rdquo; leads to infinite regress.</p>
<h4 id="a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge-3">A priori and a posteriori knowledge <a href="#a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h4><p>One of the most important distinctions in epistemology is between what can be known a priori (independently of experience) and what can be known a posteriori (through experience). The terms originate from the Analytic methods of Aristotle&rsquo;s Organon, and may be roughly defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A priori knowledge is knowledge that is known independently of experience (that is, it is non-empirical, or arrived at before experience, usually by reason). It will henceforth be acquired through anything that is independent from experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A posteriori knowledge is knowledge that is known by experience (that is, it is empirical, or arrived at through experience).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Views that emphasize the importance of a priori knowledge are generally classified as rationalist. Views that emphasize the importance of a posteriori knowledge are generally classified as empiricist.</p>
<h3 id="belief-2">Belief <a href="#belief-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>One of the core concepts in epistemology is belief. A belief is an attitude that a person holds regarding anything that they take to be true. For instance, to believe that snow is white is comparable to accepting the truth of the proposition &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;. Beliefs can be occurrent (e.g. a person actively thinking &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;), or they can be dispositional (e.g. a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;). While there is not universal agreement about the nature of belief, most contemporary philosophers hold the view that a disposition to express belief B qualifies as holding the belief B. There are various different ways that contemporary philosophers have tried to describe beliefs, including as representations of ways that the world could be (Jerry Fodor), as dispositions to act as if certain things are true (Roderick Chisholm), as interpretive schemes for making sense of someone&rsquo;s actions (Daniel Dennett and Donald Davidson), or as mental states that fill a particular function (Hilary Putnam). Some have also attempted to offer significant revisions to our notion of belief, including eliminativists about belief who argue that there is no phenomenon in the natural world which corresponds to our folk psychological concept of belief (Paul Churchland) and formal epistemologists who aim to replace our bivalent notion of belief (&ldquo;either I have a belief or I don&rsquo;t have a belief&rdquo;) with the more permissive, probabilistic notion of credence (&ldquo;there is an entire spectrum of degrees of belief, not a simple dichotomy between belief and non-belief&rdquo;).</p>
<p>While belief plays a significant role in epistemological debates surrounding knowledge and justification, it also has many other philosophical debates in its own right. Notable debates include: &ldquo;What is the rational way to revise one&rsquo;s beliefs when presented with various sorts of evidence?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Is the content of our beliefs entirely determined by our mental states, or do the relevant facts have any bearing on our beliefs (e.g. if I believe that I&rsquo;m holding a glass of water, is the non-mental fact that water is H2O part of the content of that belief)?&rdquo;; &ldquo;How fine-grained or coarse-grained are our beliefs?&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Must it be possible for a belief to be expressible in language, or are there non-linguistic beliefs?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="truth-2">Truth <a href="#truth-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Truth is the property or state of being in accordance with facts or reality. On most views, truth is the correspondence of language or thought to a mind-independent world. This is called the correspondence theory of truth. Among philosophers who think that it is possible to analyze the conditions necessary for knowledge, virtually all of them accept that truth is such a condition. There is much less agreement about the extent to which a knower must know why something is true in order to know. On such views, something being known implies that it is true. However, this should not be confused for the more contentious view that one must know that one knows in order to know (the KK principle).</p>
<p>Epistemologists disagree about whether belief is the only truth-bearer. Other common suggestions for things that can bear the property of being true include propositions, sentences, thoughts, utterances, and judgments. Plato, in his Gorgias, argues that belief is the most commonly invoked truth-bearer.</p>
<p>Many of the debates regarding truth are at the crossroads of epistemology and logic. Some contemporary debates regarding truth include: How do we define truth? Is it even possible to give an informative definition of truth? What things are truth-bearers and are therefore capable of being true or false? Are truth and falsity bivalent, or are there other truth values? What are the criteria of truth that allow us to identify it and to distinguish it from falsity? What role does truth play in constituting knowledge? And is truth absolute, or is it merely relative to one&rsquo;s perspective?</p>
<h3 id="justification-2">Justification <a href="#justification-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>As the term &ldquo;justification&rdquo; is used in epistemology, a belief is justified if one has good reason for holding it. Loosely speaking, justification is the reason that someone holds a rationally admissible belief, on the assumption that it is a good reason for holding it. Sources of justification might include perceptual experience (the evidence of the senses), reason, and authoritative testimony, among others. Importantly however, a belief being justified does not guarantee that the belief is true, since a person could be justified in forming beliefs based on very convincing evidence that was nonetheless deceiving.</p>
<h4 id="internalism-and-externalism-2">Internalism and externalism <a href="#internalism-and-externalism-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h4><p>A central debate about the nature of justification is a debate between epistemological externalists on the one hand and epistemological internalists on the other. While epistemic externalism first arose in attempts to overcome the Gettier problem, it has flourished in the time since as an alternative way of conceiving of epistemic justification. The initial development of epistemic externalism is often attributed to Alvin Goldman, although numerous others have contributed to its development and refinement.</p>

Epistemologists focus on understanding the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge, as well as epistemic justification and the rationality of belief. Central debates in epistemology revolve around four core areas: the philosophical analysis of knowledge and the conditions required for belief to constitute knowledge; potential sources of knowledge such as perception, reason, memory, and testimony; the structure of a body of knowledge or justified belief; and philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility of knowledge.</p>

<li>Potential sources of knowledge and justified belief, such as perception, reason, memory, and testimony.</li>
<li>The structure of a body of knowledge or justified belief, including whether all justified beliefs must be derived from justified foundational beliefs or whether justification requires only a coherent set of beliefs.</li>
<li>Philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility of knowledge, and related problems, such as whether skepticism poses a threat to our ordinary knowledge claims and whether it is possible to refute skeptical arguments.</li>

<h1 id="the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam">The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam <a href="#the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is a big dam being built on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia. It started being built in 2011 and when it&rsquo;s finished, it will be the biggest power plant in Africa that makes electricity from water, also known as hydroelectric power. The dam is being built to help Ethiopia with its need for more electricity and to sell electricity to neighboring countries. The dam is being filled with water in stages. The first stage began in July 2020 and the third stage was completed in August 2022. The dam started producing electricity for the first time in February 2022.</p>
<p>The Blue Nile River is very important in Ethiopia and is often referred to as &rsquo;the river of rivers&rsquo;. The place where the dam is being built was identified by the United States Bureau of Reclamation between 1956 and 1964. However, because of wars in Ethiopia, the project didn&rsquo;t start until much later. The dam was originally called &ldquo;Project X&rdquo;, then the &ldquo;Millennium Dam&rdquo;, and finally the &ldquo;Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam&rdquo;. The dam is being paid for by the Ethiopian government and private donations.</p>
<p>There has been some disagreement about the dam. Egypt, which is downstream from the dam, is worried that the dam will reduce the amount of water available from the Nile River. Ethiopia disagrees and says the dam will actually increase water flows to Egypt. There have been many talks and negotiations between the countries about the dam.</p>
<h1 id="the-design-and-cost-of-the-dam">The Design and Cost of the Dam <a href="#the-design-and-cost-of-the-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The design of the dam has changed several times since 2011. The dam is expected to cost close to 5 billion US dollars. Because of Egypt&rsquo;s control over the Nile water share, Ethiopia has had to pay for the dam by selling bonds and asking employees to contribute part of their incomes. The dam is made up of two parts, the main dam and a smaller dam called a saddle dam. The dam will have three spillways, which are passages for surplus water to flow over.</p>
<p>The dam will have two powerhouses that will be equipped with 13 turbines. These turbines will generate electricity. The electricity will then be delivered to the national grid, which is a network that delivers electricity from producers to consumers. There are also plans for power lines to be built.</p>
<h1 id="early-power-generation-and-other-details">Early Power Generation and Other Details <a href="#early-power-generation-and-other-details" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Two of the turbines started working in 2022, delivering electricity to the national grid. There are also two &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets at the dam that can deliver water to Sudan and Egypt if needed. These outlets can also be used during the initial filling process of the reservoir. The space below the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets is the primary buffer space for alluvium through siltation and sedimentation, which is when water or wind carries small particles of rock and dirt and deposits them somewhere else.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-the-dam-being-built">Where is the dam being built? <a href="#where-is-the-dam-being-built" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam is being built in a place in Ethiopia called the Benishangul-Gumuz Region.

<h2 id="why-is-the-dam-being-built">Why is the dam being built? <a href="#why-is-the-dam-being-built" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The main reason the dam is being built is to make electricity. Ethiopia, the country where the dam is being built, doesn&rsquo;t have enough electricity for everyone who lives there. The dam will help solve this problem by making a lot of electricity. The dam will also be able to sell some of its electricity to other countries nearby.</p>
<h2 id="how-big-will-the-dam-be">How big will the dam be? <a href="#how-big-will-the-dam-be" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam will be able to make 5.15 gigawatts of electricity. That&rsquo;s a lot of electricity! In fact, it&rsquo;s so much that it will be one of the 20 largest power plants in the entire world.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-the-dam-being-filled-with-water">How is the dam being filled with water? <a href="#how-is-the-dam-being-filled-with-water" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam is being filled with water in stages. The first stage started in July 2020. By August 2020, the water level in the dam had increased to 540 meters. That&rsquo;s 40 meters higher than the bottom of the river, which is 500 meters above sea level. The second stage of filling was completed on 19 July 2021, when the water level increased to around 575 meters. The third stage was completed on 12 August 2022, when the water level reached 600 meters. As of November 2022, the water level is around 605 meters. It will take between 4 and 7 years to fill the dam with water.</p>
<h2 id="when-did-the-dam-start-making-electricity">When did the dam start making electricity? <a href="#when-did-the-dam-start-making-electricity" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam started making electricity for the first time on 20 February 2022. It was able to deliver electricity to the grid at a rate of 375 MW. A second turbine, which is a machine that helps make electricity, was started in August 2022. This second turbine can also make 375 MW of electricity.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-history-of-the-dam">What is the history of the dam? <a href="#what-is-the-history-of-the-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The place where the dam is being built was first identified by the United States Bureau of Reclamation between 1956 and 1964. However, due to a change in government and a civil war in Ethiopia, the project did not move forward. The Ethiopian Government surveyed the site in October 2009 and August 2010. In November 2010, a design for the dam was submitted by James Kelston. On 31 March 2011, a contract was awarded to an Italian company called Salini Impregilo to build the dam. The foundation stone of the dam was laid on 2 April 2011 by the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-controversies-about-the-dam">What are some controversies about the dam? <a href="#what-are-some-controversies-about-the-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam has caused a lot of controversy in the region. Egypt, a country located downstream of the dam, opposes the dam. Egypt is worried that the dam will reduce the amount of water available from the Nile River. The Nile River is very important to Egypt because it provides about 97% of its irrigation and drinking water. Ethiopia, on the other hand, argues that the dam will not reduce water availability downstream and will also regulate water for irrigation.</p>

This is about 7% of the money that Ethiopia made in 2016. Because of Egypt&rsquo;s opposition to the dam, Ethiopia has had to pay for the dam itself. It has done this through selling bonds and asking employees to contribute a portion of their incomes. The Exim Bank of China has also funded 1 billion US dollars for turbines and electrical equipment.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-design-of-the-dam">What is the design of the dam? <a href="#what-is-the-design-of-the-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The design of the dam has changed several times between 2011 and 2019. This has affected both the electrical parameters and the storage parameters. The dam will have two dams, three spillways, and will be able to generate and distribute power. The dam will also have a system for early power generation and a system for dealing with siltation and evaporation.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-dams">What are the dams? <a href="#what-are-the-dams" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The main dam will be 145 meters tall and 1,780 meters long. It will be made of roller-compacted concrete. The second dam, called the saddle dam, will be 50 meters high and 4.9 kilometers long. The reservoir behind both dams will have a storage capacity of 74 cubic kilometers.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-spillways">What are the spillways? <a href="#what-are-the-spillways" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dams will have three spillways. These are structures that allow water to flow out of the dam. The main spillway will be controlled by six floodgates and have a design discharge of 14,700 cubic meters per second. The second spillway, called the auxiliary spillway, sits at the center of the main dam. The third spillway, called the emergency spillway, is located to the right of the saddle dam.</p>
<h2 id="how-will-the-dam-generate-and-distribute-power">How will the dam generate and distribute power? <a href="#how-will-the-dam-generate-and-distribute-power" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam will be equipped with 2 x 375 MW Francis turbine-generators and 11 x 400 MW turbines. The total installed capacity with all turbine-generators will be 5,150 MW. The average annual flow of the Blue Nile being available for power generation is expected to be 1,547 cubic meters per second.

It has been under construction since 2011 and is located in the Benishangul-Gumuz Region of Ethiopia, about 45 km (28 mi) east of the border with Sudan. The primary purpose of the dam is to produce electricity to help Ethiopia&rsquo;s severe energy shortage and to export electricity to neighboring countries. Once completed, the dam will have a planned installed capacity of 5.15 gigawatts, making it the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa and one of the 20 largest in the world.</p>
<p>The dam&rsquo;s reservoir started filling in July 2020, and by August 2020, the water level had increased to 540 meters, 40 meters higher than the bottom of the river. The second phase of filling was completed in July 2021, raising the water level to around 575 meters. The third filling was completed in August 2022 to a level of 600 meters (2,000 ft), 25 m (82 ft) higher than the prior year&rsquo;s second fill. The dam started producing electricity for the first time on 20 February 2022, delivering it to the grid at a rate of 375 MW. A second 375 MW turbine was commissioned in August 2022.</p>
<p>The dam&rsquo;s construction and potential impacts have been a source of regional controversy. Egypt, a country which depends on the Nile for about 97% of its irrigation and drinking water, has demanded that Ethiopia cease construction on the dam as a precondition to negotiations. Ethiopia, however, denies that the dam will have a negative impact on downstream water flows and contends that the dam will, in fact, increase water flows to Egypt by reducing evaporation on Lake Nasser.</p>
<h1 id="cost-and-financing">Cost and Financing <a href="#cost-and-financing" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The GERD is estimated to cost close to 5 billion US dollars, about 7% of the 2016 Ethiopian gross national product. Due to Egypt&rsquo;s campaign to keep control on the Nile water share, Ethiopia has been forced to finance the GERD through crowdfunding, internal fundraising, selling bonds, and persuading employees to contribute a portion of their incomes. Of the total cost, 1 billion US dollars for turbines and electrical equipment were funded by the Exim Bank of China.</p>
<h1 id="design-and-power-generation">Design and Power Generation <a href="#design-and-power-generation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The dam&rsquo;s design has changed several times between 2011 and 2019. Initially, in 2011, the hydropower plant was to receive 15 generating units with 350 MW nameplate capacity each, resulting in a total installed capacity of 5,250 MW. However, the design was later changed to add another 450 MW for a total of 6,450 MW. The dam&rsquo;s storage parameters also changed over time. Originally, in 2011, the dam was planned to be 145 m (476 ft) tall with a volume of 10.1 million m¬≥. However, after the Independent Panel of Experts (IPoE) made its recommendations in 2013, the dam parameters were changed to account for higher flow volumes in case of extreme floods.</p>
<p>The dam will have two power houses, equipped with 2 x 375 MW Francis turbine-generators and 11 x 400 MW turbines. The total installed capacity with all turbine-generators will be 5,150 MW. The average annual flow of the Blue Nile being available for power generation is expected to be 1,547 m3/s (54,600 cu ft/s), which gives rise to an annual expectation for power generation of 16,153 GWh.</p>

The actual water level as of November 2022 is around 605 meters. It is estimated that it will take between 4 and 7 years to fill the dam with water, depending on hydrologic conditions during the filling period.</p>
<p>On 20 February 2022, the dam produced electricity for the first time, delivering it to the grid at a rate of 375 MW. A second 375 MW turbine was commissioned in August 2022.</p>
<h2 id="background-1">Background <a href="#background-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Blue Nile river, known as &ldquo;Abay&rdquo; in Ethiopia, is derived from the Ge&rsquo;ez word for &lsquo;great&rsquo;, signifying its importance as &rsquo;the river of rivers&rsquo;. The eventual site for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam was identified by the United States Bureau of Reclamation during the Blue Nile survey conducted between 1956 and 1964 during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. However, due to the coup d&rsquo;√©tat of 1974 and the subsequent 17-year-long Ethiopian Civil War, the project did not progress. The Ethiopian Government surveyed the site in October 2009 and August 2010, and in November 2010, a design for the dam was submitted by James Kelston.</p>
<p>On 31 March 2011, a day after the project was made public, a US$4.8 billion contract was awarded without competitive bidding to Italian company Salini Impregilo, and the dam&rsquo;s foundation stone was laid on 2 April 2011 by the Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. A rock-crushing plant was constructed, along with a small air strip for fast transportation. The expectation was for the first two power-generation turbines to become operational after 44 months of construction, or early 2015.</p>
<h2 id="regional-controversy">Regional Controversy <a href="#regional-controversy" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The potential impacts of the dam have been the source of severe regional controversy.

Zenawi argued, based on an unnamed study, that the dam would not reduce water availability downstream and would also regulate water for irrigation. In May 2011, it was announced that Ethiopia would share blueprints for the dam with Egypt so that the downstream impact could be examined.</p>
<p>The dam was originally called &ldquo;Project X&rdquo;, and after its contract was announced it was called the Millennium Dam. On 15 April 2011, the Council of Ministers renamed it Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Ethiopia has a potential for about 45 GW of hydropower. The dam is being funded by government bonds and private donations. It was slated for completion in July 2017.</p>
<p>Egypt has demanded that Ethiopia cease construction on the dam as a precondition to negotiations, has sought regional support for its position, and some political leaders have discussed methods to sabotage it. Egypt has planned a diplomatic initiative to undermine support for the dam in the region as well as in other countries supporting the project such as China and Italy. However, other nations in the Nile Basin Initiative have expressed support for the dam, including Sudan, the only other nation downstream of the Blue Nile, although Sudan&rsquo;s position towards the dam has varied over time. In 2014, Sudan accused Egypt of inflaming the situation.</p>
<p>Ethiopia denies that the dam will have a negative impact on downstream water flows and contends that the dam will, in fact, increase water flows to Egypt by reducing evaporation on Lake Nasser. Ethiopia has accused Egypt of being unreasonable; In October 2019, Egypt stated that talks with Sudan and Ethiopia over the operation of a $4 billion hydropower dam that Ethiopia is building on the Nile have reached a deadlock. Beginning in November 2019, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin began facilitating negotiations between the three countries.</p>
<h2 id="cost-and-financing-2">Cost and Financing <a href="#cost-and-financing-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is estimated to cost close to 5 billion US dollars, about 7% of the 2016 Ethiopian gross national product. The lack of international financing for projects on the Blue Nile River has persistently been attributed to Egypt&rsquo;s campaign to keep control on the Nile water share. Ethiopia has been forced to finance the GERD with crowd funding through internal fund raising in the form of selling bonds and persuading employees to contribute a portion of their incomes. Contributions are made in the newly official website confirmed by the verified account of the Office of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia. Of the total cost, 1 billion US dollars for turbines and electrical equipment were funded by the Exim Bank of China.</p>
<h2 id="design-1">Design <a href="#design-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The design of the dam changed several times between 2011 and 2019, affecting both the electrical parameters and the storage parameters. Originally, in 2011, the hydropower plant was to receive 15 generating units with 350 MW nameplate capacity each, resulting in a total installed capacity of 5,250 MW with an expected power generation of 15,128 GWh per year. Its planned generation capacity was later increased to 6,000 MW, through 16 generating units with 375 MW nominal capacity each. The expected power generation was estimated at 15,692 GWh per year. In 2017, the design was again changed to add another 450 MW for a total of 6,450 MW, with a planned power generation of 16,153 GWh per year.</p>
<p>Not only the electrical power parameters changed over time, but also the storage parameters. Originally, in 2011, the dam was planned to be 145 m (476 ft) tall with a volume of 10.1 million m¬≥. The reservoir was planned to have a volume of 66 km3 (54,000,000 acre‚ãÖft) and a surface area of 1,680 km2 (650 sq mi) at full supply level. The rock-filled saddle dam beside the main dam was planned to have a height of 45 m (148 ft) meters, a length of 4,800 m (15,700 ft) and a volume of 15 million m¬≥.</p>
<p>In 2013, an Independent Panel of Experts (IPoE) assessed the dam and its technological parameters. At that time, the reservoir sizes were changed already. The size of the reservoir at full supply level went up to 1,874 km2 (724 sq mi), an increase of 194 km2 (75 sq mi). The storage volume at full supply level had increased to 74 km3 (60,000,000 acre‚ãÖft), an increase of 7 km3 (1.7 cu mi). These numbers did not change after 2013. The storage volume of 74 km3 (60,000,000 acre‚ãÖft) is representing nearly entire 84 km3 (68,000,000 acre‚ãÖft) annual flow of Nile.</p>
<p>After the IPoE made its recommendations, in 2013, the dam parameters were changed to account for higher flow volumes in case of extreme floods: a main dam height of 155 m (509 ft), an increase of 10 m (33 ft), with a length of 1,780 m (5,840 ft) (no change) and a dam volume of 10.2 million cubic metres (360√ó10^6 cu ft), an increase of 100,000 m3 (3,500,000 cu ft). The outlet parameters did not change, only the crest of the main dam was raised. The rock saddle dam went up to a height of 50 m (160 ft), an increase of 5 metres (16 ft), with a length of 5,200 m (17,100 ft), an increase of 400 metres (1,300 ft). The volume of the rock saddle dam increased to 16.5 million cubic metres (580√ó10^6 cu ft), an increase of 1.5 million cubic metres (53√ó10^6 cu ft).</p>
<p>The design parameters as of August 2017 are as follows, given the changes as outlined above.</p>
<h3 id="two-dams">Two Dams <a href="#two-dams" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The zero level of the main dam, the ground level, will be at a height of about 500 m (1,600 ft) above sea level, corresponding roughly to the level of the river bed of the Blue Nile. Counting from the ground level, the main gravity dam will be 145 m (476 ft) tall, 1,780 m (5,840 ft) long and composed of roller-compacted concrete. The crest of the dam will be at a height of 655 m (2,149 ft) above sea level. The outlets of the two powerhouses are below the ground level, the total height of the dam will, therefore, be slightly higher than that of the given height of the dam. In some publications, the main contractor constructing the dam puts forward a number of 170 m (560 ft) for the dam height, which might account for the additional depth of the dam below ground level, which would mean 15 m (49 ft) of excavations from the basement before filling the reservoir. The structural volume of the dam will be 10,200,000 m3 (13,300,000 cu yd). The main dam will be 40 km (25 mi) from the border with Sudan.</p>
<p>Supporting the main dam and reservoir will be a curved and 4.9 km (3 mi) long and 50 m (164 ft) high rock-fill saddle dam. The ground level of the saddle dam is at an elevation of about 600 m (2,000 ft) above sea level. The surface of the saddle dam has a bituminous finish, to keep the interior of the dam dry. The saddle dam will be just 3.3‚Äì3.5 km (2‚Äì2 mi) away from the border with Sudan, it is much closer to the border than the main dam.</p>
<p>The reservoir behind both dams will have a storage capacity of 74 km3 (60,000,000 acre‚ãÖft) and a surface area of 1,874 km2 (724 sq mi) when at full supply level of 640 m (2,100 ft) above sea level  The full supply level is therefore 140 m (460 ft) above the ground level of the main dam. Hydropower generation can happen between reservoir levels of 590 m (1,940 ft), the so-called minimum operating level, and 640 m (2,100 ft), the full supply level. The live storage volume, usable for power generation between both levels is then 59.2 km3 (48,000,000 acre‚ãÖft). The first 90 m (300 ft) of the height of the dam will be a dead height for the reservoir, leading to a dead storage volume of the reservoir of 14.8 km3 (12,000,000 acre‚ãÖft).</p>
<h3 id="three-spillways">Three Spillways <a href="#three-spillways" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The dams will have three spillways. All (each?) using approximately 18,000 cubic meters of concrete. These spillways together are designed for a flood of up to 38,500 m3/s (1,360,000 cu ft/s), an event not considered to happen at all, as this discharge volume is the so-called &lsquo;Probable Maximum Flood&rsquo;. All waters from the three spillways are designed to discharge into the Blue Nile before the river enters Sudanese territory.</p>
<p>The main and gated spillway is located to the left of the main dam and will be controlled by six floodgates and have a design discharge of 14,700 m3/s (520,000 cu ft/s) in total. The spillway will be 84 m (276 ft) wide at the outflow gates. The base level of the spillway will be at 624.9 m (2,050 ft), well below the full supply level.</p>
<p>An ungated spillway, the auxiliary spillway, sits at the center of the main dam with an open width of about 205 m (673 ft). This spillway has a base-level at 640 m (2,100 ft), which is exactly the full supply level of the reservoir. The dam crest is 15 m (49 ft) higher to the left and to the right of the spillway. This ungated spillway is only expected to be used, if the reservoir is both full and the flow exceeds 14,700 m3/s (520,000 cu ft/s), a flow value, that is expected to be exceeded once every ten years.</p>
<p>A third spillway, an emergency spillway, is located to the right of the curved saddle dam, with a base level at 642 m (2,106 ft). This emergency spillway has an open space of about 1,200 m (3,900 ft) along its rim. This third spillway will carry water only if the conditions for a flood of more than around 30,000 m3/s (1,100,000 cu ft/s) are given, corresponding to a flood to occur only once every 10,000 years.</p>
<h3 id="power-generation-and-distribution">Power Generation and Distribution <a href="#power-generation-and-distribution" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Flanking either side of the auxiliary ungated spillway at the center of the dam will be two power houses, that will be equipped with 2 x 375 MW Francis turbine-generators and 11 x 400 MW turbines. The total installed capacity with all turbine-generators will be 5,150 MW. The average annual flow of the Blue Nile being available for power generation is expected to be 1,547 m3/s (54,600 cu ft/s), which gives rise to an annual expectation for power generation of 16,153 GWh, corresponding to a plant load factor (or capacity factor) of 28.6%.</p>
<p>The Francis turbines inside the power houses are installed in a vertical manner, raising 7 m (23 ft) above the ground level. For the foreseen operation between the minimum operating level and the full supply level, the water head available to the turbines will be 83‚Äì133 m (272‚Äì436 ft) high. A switching station will be located close to the main dam, where the generated power will be delivered to the national grid. Four 500 kV main power transmission lines were completed in August 2017, all going to Holeta and then with several 400 kV lines to the metropolitan area of Addis Ababa. Two 400 kV lines run from the dam to the Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant. Also planned are 500 kV high-voltage direct current lines.</p>
<h3 id="early-power-generation">Early Power Generation <a href="#early-power-generation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Two non-upgraded turbine-generators with 375 MW were first to go into operation with 750 MW delivered to the national power grid, while the first turbine  was commissioned in February 2022 and the second one in August 2022. The two units sit within the 10 unit powerhouse to the right side of the dam at the auxiliary spillway. They are fed by two special intakes within the dam structure that are located at a height of 540 m (1,770 ft) above sea level. That power generation started at a water level of 560 m (1,840 ft), 30 m (98 ft) below the minimum operating level of the other 11 turbine-generators. At that level, the reservoir has been filled with roughly 5.5 km3 (1.3 cu mi) of water, which corresponds to roughly 11% of the annual inflow of 48.8 km3 (11.7 cu mi). During the rainy season, this is expected to happen within days to weeks. The first stage filling of the reservoir for early generation was completed on 20 July 2020.</p>
<h3 id="siltation-evaporation">Siltation, Evaporation <a href="#siltation-evaporation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Two &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets at 542 m (1,778 ft) above sea level or 42 m (138 ft) above the local river bed level are available for delivering water to Sudan and Egypt under special circumstances, in particular for irrigation purposes downstream, if the level of the reservoir falls below the minimum operating level of 590 m (1,940 ft) but also during the initial filling process of the reservoir.</p>
<p>The space below the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets is the primary buffer space for alluvium through siltation and sedimentation. For the Roseires Reservoir just downstream from the GERD site, the average siltation and sedimentation volume (without GERD in place) amounts to around 0.035 km3 (28,000 acre‚ãÖft) per year. Due to the large size of the GERD reservoir, the average siltation and sedimentation volume is expected to be much lower.</p>

<p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, currently under construction on the Blue Nile River, is set to be Africa&rsquo;s largest hydroelectric power plant. The dam&rsquo;s primary purpose is to alleviate Ethiopia&rsquo;s energy shortage and export electricity to neighboring countries. Despite opposition from Egypt, which relies heavily on the Nile for water, Ethiopia maintains that the dam will not reduce downstream water availability and will actually increase water flows to Egypt. The dam has undergone several design changes, and its current power generation capacity is 5,150 MW. The dam began producing electricity for the first time in February 2022.</p>

<p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), previously known as the Millennium Dam, is a gravity dam on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia. The dam, which has been under construction since 2011, is located in the Benishangul-Gumuz Region of Ethiopia, approximately 45 km east of the Sudanese border. The primary purpose of the dam is to produce electricity to alleviate Ethiopia&rsquo;s severe energy shortage and to export electricity to neighbouring countries. The dam is set to have a planned installed capacity of 5.15 gigawatts, making it the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa and one of the 20 largest in the world once completed. The dam&rsquo;s reservoir began filling in July 2020 and is expected to take between 4 and 7 years to fill completely, depending on hydrologic conditions.</p>
<p>The site for the GERD was identified by the United States Bureau of Reclamation between 1956 and 1964, during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. However, due to political instability, the project did not progress until the Ethiopian Government surveyed the site in 2009 and 2010. The dam was originally referred to as &ldquo;Project X&rdquo; and later the Millennium Dam, before being renamed the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in 2011. The dam has been a source of regional controversy, particularly with Egypt, which depends on the Nile for about 97% of its irrigation and drinking water and believes the dam will reduce the amount of water available from the Nile.</p>
<p>The GERD is estimated to cost close to 5 billion US dollars, approximately 7% of the 2016 Ethiopian gross national product. Due to Egypt&rsquo;s campaign to maintain control over the Nile water share, the project has struggled to secure international financing and has instead been financed through internal fundraising efforts, including selling bonds and persuading employees to contribute a portion of their incomes. The dam&rsquo;s design has changed several times since 2011, affecting both its electrical and storage parameters. The dam will be supported by a rock-fill saddle dam and will have three spillways. The dam will have two power houses, equipped with 2 x 375 MW Francis turbine-generators and 11 x 400 MW turbines, resulting in a total installed capacity of 5,150 MW.</p>

<h1 id="the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-an-in-depth-analysis">The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam: An In-depth Analysis <a href="#the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-an-in-depth-analysis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), also known in Amharic as TƒÅlƒÅqu ye-ƒ™ty≈çppyƒÅ HidƒÅsƒì Gidib, is a gravity dam located on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia. The dam, which has been under construction since 2011, is situated in the Benishangul-Gumuz Region of Ethiopia, approximately 45 km east of the border with Sudan. The primary purpose of the dam is to generate electricity to alleviate Ethiopia&rsquo;s severe energy shortage and to export electricity to neighboring countries.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-the-dam">Overview of the Dam <a href="#overview-of-the-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The GERD, formerly known as the Millennium Dam and sometimes referred to as the Hidase Dam, is expected to be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa upon completion, with a planned installed capacity of 5.15 gigawatts. This also places it among the top 20 largest hydroelectric power plants in the world.</p>
<p>The first phase of filling the reservoir began in July 2020, and by August 2020, the water level had increased to 540 meters, which is 40 meters higher than the bottom of the river, which is at 500 meters above sea level. The second phase of filling was completed on 19 July 2021, with the water level increasing to around 575 meters. The third filling was completed on 12 August 2022 to a level of 600 meters, 25 meters higher than the prior year&rsquo;s second fill. The actual water level as of November 2022 is around 605 meters. It is estimated that it will take between 4 and 7 years to fill the dam with water, depending on hydrologic conditions during the filling period.</p>
<p>On 20 February 2022, the dam produced electricity for the first time, delivering it to the grid at a rate of 375 MW. A second 375 MW turbine was commissioned in August 2022.</p>
<h2 id="historical-background-1">Historical Background <a href="#historical-background-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Blue Nile river, known in Ethiopia as &ldquo;Abay&rdquo;, is derived from the Ge&rsquo;ez word for &lsquo;great&rsquo;, signifying its status as &rsquo;the river of rivers&rsquo;. The site for the GERD was identified by the United States Bureau of Reclamation during the Blue Nile survey conducted between 1956 and 1964 during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. However, due to the coup d&rsquo;√©tat of 1974 and the ensuing 17-year-long Ethiopian Civil War, the project did not progress. The Ethiopian Government surveyed the site in October 2009 and August 2010, and in November 2010, a design for the dam was submitted by James Kelston.</p>
<p>On 31 March 2011, a day after the project was made public, a US$4.8 billion contract was awarded without competitive bidding to Italian company Salini Impregilo, and the dam&rsquo;s foundation stone was laid on 2 April 2011 by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. A rock-crushing plant was constructed, along with a small air strip for fast transportation. The expectation was for the first two power-generation turbines to become operational after 44 months of construction, or early 2015.</p>
<h2 id="regional-controversy-1">Regional Controversy <a href="#regional-controversy-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The potential impacts of the dam have been the source of severe regional controversy. Egypt, located over 2,500 kilometres downstream of the site, opposes the dam, which it believes will reduce the amount of water available from the Nile. Zenawi argued, based on an unnamed study, that the dam would not reduce water availability downstream and would also regulate water for irrigation. In May 2011, it was announced that Ethiopia would share blueprints for the dam with Egypt so that the downstream impact could be examined.</p>
<p>The dam was originally called &ldquo;Project X&rdquo;, and after its contract was announced it was called the Millennium Dam. On 15 April 2011, the Council of Ministers renamed it Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Ethiopia has a potential for about 45 GW of hydropower. The dam is being funded by government bonds and private donations. It was slated for completion in July 2017.</p>
<p>Egypt, a country which depends on the Nile for about 97% of its irrigation and drinking water, has demanded that Ethiopia cease construction on the dam as a precondition to negotiations, has sought regional support for its position, and some political leaders have discussed methods to sabotage it. Egypt has planned a diplomatic initiative to undermine support for the dam in the region as well as in other countries supporting the project such as China and Italy. However, other nations in the Nile Basin Initiative have expressed support for the dam, including Sudan, the only other nation downstream of the Blue Nile, although Sudan&rsquo;s position towards the dam has varied over time. In 2014, Sudan accused Egypt of inflaming the situation. Ethiopia denies that the dam will have a negative impact on downstream water flows and contends that the dam will, in fact, increase water flows to Egypt by reducing evaporation on Lake Nasser.</p>
<h2 id="cost-and-financing-3">Cost and Financing <a href="#cost-and-financing-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The GERD is estimated to cost close to 5 billion US dollars, which is about 7% of the 2016 Ethiopian gross national product. The lack of international financing for projects on the Blue Nile River has persistently been attributed to Egypt&rsquo;s campaign to keep control on the Nile water share. Ethiopia has been forced to finance the GERD with crowd funding through internal fund raising in the form of selling bonds and persuading employees to contribute a portion of their incomes. Of the total cost, 1 billion US dollars for turbines and electrical equipment were funded by the Exim Bank of China.</p>
<h2 id="design-2">Design <a href="#design-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The design of the dam changed several times between 2011 and 2019, affecting both the electrical parameters and the storage parameters. Originally, in 2011, the hydropower plant was to receive 15 generating units with 350 MW nameplate capacity each, resulting in a total installed capacity of 5,250 MW with an expected power generation of 15,128 GWh per year.</p>
<p>Its planned generation capacity was later increased to 6,000 MW, through 16 generating units with 375 MW nominal capacity each. The expected power generation was estimated at 15,692 GWh per year. In 2017, the design was again changed to add another 450 MW for a total of 6,450 MW, with a planned power generation of 16,153 GWh per year.</p>
<p>That was achieved by upgrading 14 of the 16 generating units from 375 MW to 400 MW without changing the nominal capacity. According to a senior Ethiopian official, on 17 October 2019, the power generation capacity of the GERD is now 5,150 MW, with 13 turbines (2x 375 MW and 11x 400 MW) down from 16 turbines.</p>
<p>Not only the electrical power parameters changed over time, but also the storage parameters. Originally, in 2011, the dam was planned to be 145 m tall with a volume of 10.1 million m¬≥. The reservoir was planned to have a volume of 66 km3 and a surface area of 1,680 km2 at full supply level. The rock-filled saddle dam beside the main dam was planned to have a height of 45 m, a length of 4,800 m and a volume of 15 million m¬≥.</p>
<p>In 2013, an Independent Panel of Experts (IPoE) assessed the dam and its technological parameters. At that time, the reservoir sizes were changed already. The size of the reservoir at full supply level went up to 1,874 km2, an increase of 194 km2. The storage volume at full supply level had increased to 74 km3, an increase of 7 km3. These numbers did not change after 2013. The storage volume of 74 km3 is representing nearly entire 84 km3 annual flow of Nile.</p>
<p>After the IPoE made its recommendations, in 2013, the dam parameters were changed to account for higher flow volumes in case of extreme floods: a main dam height of 155 m, an increase of 10 m, with a length of 1,780 m (no change) and a dam volume of 10.2 million cubic metres, an increase of 100,000 m3. The outlet parameters did not change, only the crest of the main dam was raised. The rock saddle dam went up to a height of 50 m, an increase of 5 metres, with a length of 5,200 m, an increase of 400 metres. The volume of the rock saddle dam increased to 16.5 million cubic metres, an increase of 1.5 million cubic metres.</p>
<p>The design parameters as of August 2017 are as follows, given the changes as outlined above:</p>
<h3 id="two-dams-1">Two Dams <a href="#two-dams-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The zero level of the main dam, the ground level, will be at a height of about 500 m above sea level, corresponding roughly to the level of the river bed of the Blue Nile.

The structural volume of the dam will be 10,200,000 m3. The main dam will be 40 km from the border with Sudan.</p>
<p>Supporting the main dam and reservoir will be a curved and 4.9 km long and 50 m high rock-fill saddle dam. The ground level of the saddle dam is at an elevation of about 600 m above sea level. The surface of the saddle dam has a bituminous finish, to keep the interior of the dam dry. The saddle dam will be just 3.3‚Äì3.5 km away from the border with Sudan, it is much closer to the border than the main dam.</p>
<p>The reservoir behind both dams will have a storage capacity of 74 km3 and a surface area of 1,874 km2 when at full supply level of 640 m above sea level. The full supply level is therefore 140 m above the ground level of the main dam. Hydropower generation can happen between reservoir levels of 590 m, the so-called minimum operating level, and 640 m, the full supply level. The live storage volume, usable for power generation between both levels is then 59.2 km3. The first 90 m of the height of the dam will be a dead height for the reservoir, leading to a dead storage volume of the reservoir of 14.8 km3.</p>
<h3 id="three-spillways-1">Three Spillways <a href="#three-spillways-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The dams will have three spillways.

<p>A third spillway, an emergency spillway, is located to the right of the curved saddle dam, with a base level at 642 m. This emergency spillway has an open space of about 1,200 m along its rim. This third spillway will carry water only if the conditions for a flood of more than around 30,000 m3/s are given, corresponding to a flood to occur only once every 10,000 years.</p>
<h3 id="power-generation-and-distribution-1">Power Generation and Distribution <a href="#power-generation-and-distribution-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Flanking either side of the auxiliary ungated spillway at the center of the dam will be two power houses, that will be equipped with 2 x 375 MW Francis turbine-generators and 11 x 400 MW turbines. The total installed capacity with all turbine-generators will be 5,150 MW. The average annual flow of the Blue Nile being available for power generation is expected to be 1,547 m3/s, which gives rise to an annual expectation for power generation of 16,153 GWh, corresponding to a plant load factor (or capacity factor) of 28.6%.</p>
<p>The Francis turbines inside the power houses are installed in a vertical manner, raising 7 m above the ground level. For the foreseen operation between the minimum operating level and the full supply level, the water head available to the turbines will be 83‚Äì133 m high. A switching station will be located close to the main dam, where the generated power will be delivered to the national grid. Four 500 kV main power transmission lines were completed in August 2017, all going to Holeta and then with several 400 kV lines to the metropolitan area of Addis Ababa. Two 400 kV lines run from the dam to the Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant. Also planned are 500 kV high-voltage direct current lines.</p>
<h3 id="early-power-generation-1">Early Power Generation <a href="#early-power-generation-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Two non-upgraded turbine-generators with 375 MW were first to go into operation with 750 MW delivered to the national power grid, while the first turbine was commissioned in February 2022 and the second one in August 2022. The two units sit within the 10 unit powerhouse to the right side of the dam at the auxiliary spillway. They are fed by two special intakes within the dam structure that are located at a height of 540 m above sea level. That power generation started at a water level of 560 m, 30 m below the minimum operating level of the other 11 turbine-generators. At that level, the reservoir has been filled with roughly 5.5 km3 of water, which corresponds to roughly 11% of the annual inflow of 48.8 km3. During the rainy season, this is expected to happen within days to weeks. The first stage filling of the reservoir for early generation was completed on 20 July 2020.</p>
<h3 id="siltation-evaporation-1">Siltation, Evaporation <a href="#siltation-evaporation-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Two &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets at 542 m above sea level or 42 m above the local river bed level are available for delivering water to Sudan and Egypt under special circumstances, in particular for irrigation purposes downstream, if the level of the reservoir falls below the minimum operating level of 590 m but also during the initial filling process of the reservoir.</p>
<p>The space below the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets is the primary buffer space for alluvium through siltation and sedimentation. For the Roseires Reservoir just downstream from the GERD site, the average siltation and sedimentation volume (without GERD in place) amounts to around 0.035 km3 per year. Due to the large size of the GERD reservoir, the expected siltation and sedimentation volume will be much less than that.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a disease that damages the protective covering of nerves in the brain and spinal cord. This can cause problems like double vision, muscle weakness, and trouble with balance. Doctors aren&rsquo;t sure what causes MS, but it might be due to the body&rsquo;s defense system attacking the nerves or a problem with the cells that make the nerve covering. It&rsquo;s also possible that genes or things in the environment, like viruses, might play a role. There isn&rsquo;t a cure for MS, but treatments can help manage symptoms and slow down the disease. MS is more common in women and usually starts between the ages of 20 and 50.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-multiple-sclerosis">Understanding Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#understanding-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a disease that harms the protective covers of nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord. Imagine the wires in your house. They are covered by a plastic layer to protect them. If that layer is damaged, the wires might not work properly. The same thing happens in your body when MS damages the protective layer of your nerves. This can cause problems like double vision, muscle weakness, and trouble with coordination. It&rsquo;s like the body&rsquo;s messaging system gets mixed up.</p>
<p>MS can show up in different ways. Sometimes, new symptoms might appear suddenly and then go away, only to come back later. Other times, the symptoms might slowly get worse over time. The cause of MS is not fully understood, but it might have to do with the body&rsquo;s immune system attacking its own cells, or with cells that produce the protective layer failing to do their job properly. Right now, there is no cure for MS, but there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>In 2022, almost one million people in the United States have MS, and it affects more than 2.8 million people around the world. It usually starts between the ages of 20 and 50 and is more common in women than in men. The name &ldquo;multiple sclerosis&rdquo; refers to the many scars that develop on the brain and spinal cord because of the disease.</p>
<h1 id="symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis">Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>People with MS can experience a wide range of symptoms, depending on where the damage in the nervous system occurs. These can include loss of sensitivity, muscle weakness, blurred vision, difficulty moving, problems with coordination and balance, and problems with speech or swallowing. Some people might also feel very tired, have pain, or have trouble with bladder and bowel control. When MS gets worse, walking can become difficult and the risk of falling increases.</p>
<p>Thinking and emotional problems, like depression or mood swings, are also common. Some people might find that their thinking slows down, or that they have trouble remembering things. However, intelligence and language skills are usually not affected. There are some signs that are particularly common in MS, like a worsening of symptoms when the body temperature rises, or an electric shock-like sensation when bending the neck.</p>
<h1 id="causes-of-multiple-sclerosis">Causes of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#causes-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The exact cause of MS is not known, but it&rsquo;s believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. That means that both your genes (the information you inherit from your parents) and things in your environment (like viruses) might play a role. There are many different microbes (tiny organisms like bacteria and viruses) that have been suggested as possible triggers for MS. One idea is that getting infected with a certain microbe early in life might protect you, while getting infected later in life might increase your risk of MS.</p>
<p>There is also a genetic aspect to MS, meaning it can run in families. If one of your parents or siblings has MS, your risk of getting it is higher. Certain genes have been linked to MS, but it&rsquo;s a complex disease that is likely influenced by many different genes. Finally, where you live might also affect your risk of MS. It&rsquo;s more common in people who live farther from the equator, although there are some exceptions. Other factors, like smoking and obesity, might also increase the risk of MS.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-multiple-sclerosis-1">Understanding Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#understanding-multiple-sclerosis-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Multiple sclerosis, often shortened to MS, is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It&rsquo;s like the body&rsquo;s electrical wiring system breaking down. The brain sends messages to the body through nerves, like wires. These nerves are covered by a protective layer called myelin, like the plastic coating around a wire. In MS, the myelin gets damaged, which makes it harder for the brain to send messages to the rest of the body. This can cause a lot of different problems, like feeling weak, having trouble moving, or having problems with seeing.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-in-ms">What Happens in MS? <a href="#what-happens-in-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>In MS, the body&rsquo;s defense system, called the immune system, starts attacking the myelin. It&rsquo;s like if a robot started attacking its own wires. Scientists aren&rsquo;t sure why this happens, but they think it might be because of a mix of genes and things in the environment, like viruses.</p>
<p>MS can show up in different ways. Sometimes, people with MS will have periods where they feel worse, called attacks, and then they&rsquo;ll feel better for a while. Other times, they might feel worse and worse over time. They might also have a mix of these two patterns.</p>
<h2 id="how-common-is-ms">How Common is MS? <a href="#how-common-is-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MS is the most common disease of this type, affecting the central nervous system. In the United States in 2022, nearly one million people have MS. Globally, about 2.8 million people were affected in 2020. MS usually starts between the ages of 20 and 50, and it&rsquo;s twice as common in women as in men.</p>
<h2 id="symptoms-of-ms">Symptoms of MS <a href="#symptoms-of-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>People with MS can have a lot of different symptoms, depending on where in the brain or spinal cord the myelin is damaged. They might have problems with seeing, like double vision or blurry vision. They might feel weak, have trouble moving, or feel tingly or numb. They might also have problems with balance, speaking, or swallowing.</p>
<p>As the disease gets worse, they might have trouble walking and might fall more often. They might also have problems with thinking or feel sad or moody. Some people with MS might feel worse when it&rsquo;s hot or when they bend their neck.</p>
<h2 id="causes-of-ms">Causes of MS <a href="#causes-of-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Scientists aren&rsquo;t sure what causes MS, but they think it might be a mix of genes and things in the environment.

<h1 id="more-about-symptoms">More About Symptoms <a href="#more-about-symptoms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>People with MS can have almost any symptom that has to do with the nervous system. The specific symptoms depend on where in the nervous system the myelin is damaged.</p>
<h2 id="common-symptoms">Common Symptoms <a href="#common-symptoms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Some common symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loss of feeling or strange feelings, like tingling or numbness</li>
<li>Weak muscles</li>
<li>Blurry vision</li>
<li>Muscle spasms</li>
<li>Trouble moving</li>

<h2 id="other-symptoms">Other Symptoms <a href="#other-symptoms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Some people with MS might feel worse when it&rsquo;s hot or when they bend their neck. This is called Uhthoff&rsquo;s phenomenon and Lhermitte&rsquo;s sign.</p>
<h1 id="causes-of-ms-1">Causes of MS <a href="#causes-of-ms-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Scientists aren&rsquo;t sure what causes MS, but they think it might be a mix of genes and things in the environment.</p>
<h2 id="genes">Genes <a href="#genes" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MS isn&rsquo;t caused by just one gene. Instead, many different genes can increase the risk of getting MS. If a person has a close relative with MS, like a twin or a sibling, they have a higher chance of getting MS.</p>
<h2 id="environment">Environment <a href="#environment" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Things in the environment might also play a role in MS. For example, MS is more common in people who live farther from the equator. Also, people who move to a different part of the world before the age of 15 might take on the risk of MS from their new region.</p>
<h2 id="other-factors">Other Factors <a href="#other-factors" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Other things might also increase the risk of MS, like smoking or being overweight. However, scientists aren&rsquo;t sure about these factors.</p>
<h1 id="what-happens-in-the-body-in-ms">What Happens in the Body in MS <a href="#what-happens-in-the-body-in-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>In MS, three main things happen in the body:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lesions form in the nervous system</strong>: These are like scars that form where the myelin is damaged. They mostly form in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, which is where the nerves are that carry messages from the brain to the rest of the body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflammation</strong>: This is when the body&rsquo;s defense system attacks the myelin. It&rsquo;s like if a robot started attacking its own wires. This causes swelling and more damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Destruction of myelin</strong>: This is when the protective layer around the nerves gets damaged or destroyed. It&rsquo;s like if the plastic coating around a wire got stripped away.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="lesions">Lesions <a href="#lesions" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The name &ldquo;multiple sclerosis&rdquo; comes from the many scars, or lesions, that form in the nervous system. These lesions mostly affect the white matter in the brain and spinal cord. The white matter is like the body&rsquo;s electrical wiring system. It carries messages between the brain, where the thinking happens, and the rest of the body.</p>
<p>When the myelin is damaged, the nerves can&rsquo;t carry messages as well. The body tries to fix the myelin, but it can&rsquo;t completely rebuild it. Over time, the nerves themselves might also get damaged.</p>
<h2 id="inflammation">Inflammation <a href="#inflammation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Inflammation is another sign of MS. This is when the body&rsquo;s defense system, the immune system, attacks the myelin. This starts a chain reaction that leads to more damage.</p>
<h2 id="blood-brain-barrier">Blood-Brain Barrier <a href="#blood-brain-barrier" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The blood-brain barrier is like a gate that keeps things out of the brain. In MS, this gate might get broken, letting things into the brain that shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>

<h1 id="multiple-sclerosis-an-overview">Multiple Sclerosis: An Overview <a href="#multiple-sclerosis-an-overview" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting the nervous system&rsquo;s ability to transmit signals. This can result in a variety of symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. For instance, someone with MS might experience double vision, muscle weakness, or trouble with sensation or coordination. The disease can take several forms, with symptoms either appearing in isolated attacks or gradually building up over time. The exact cause of MS is unclear, but it&rsquo;s thought to be related to the immune system or a failure of the cells that produce myelin, the insulating cover of nerve cells. Factors like genetics and environmental factors, such as viral infections, could also play a role. As of now, there is no known cure for MS, but treatments can help improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks.</p>
<p>MS is the most common immune-mediated disorder affecting the central nervous system. In 2022, nearly one million people in the United States have MS, and in 2020, about 2.8 million people were affected globally. The disease usually begins between the ages of 20 and 50 and is twice as common in women as in men. French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot first described MS in 1868. The term &ldquo;multiple sclerosis&rdquo; refers to the multiple glial scars (or plaques or lesions) that develop on the white matter of the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<h2 id="symptoms-and-diagnosis">Symptoms and Diagnosis <a href="#symptoms-and-diagnosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The symptoms of MS can vary greatly and depend on the locations of the lesions within the nervous system. These can include loss of sensitivity, muscle weakness, blurred vision, difficulty moving, and problems with coordination and balance. Cognitive difficulties and emotional problems are also common. There are two main patterns of symptom occurrence: episodes of sudden worsening followed by improvement, or a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery. MS is usually diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests.</p>
<h2 id="causes-and-risk-factors">Causes and Risk Factors <a href="#causes-and-risk-factors" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>While the exact cause of MS is unknown, it&rsquo;s believed to be a result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS. For example, the Epstein-Barr herpes virus (EBV), which infects about 95% of adults, has been linked to MS. Genetics also play a significant role in MS. The disease is not considered a Mendelian disease, meaning it&rsquo;s not caused by a single gene, but rather multiple genetic variations that increase the risk. Other risk factors include smoking, stress, and obesity during adolescence and young adulthood.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-multiple-sclerosis-ms">Understanding Multiple Sclerosis (MS) <a href="#understanding-multiple-sclerosis-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a common disease that damages the protective covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. This damage interrupts the nervous system&rsquo;s ability to transmit signals, leading to various physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. The symptoms can include double vision, loss of vision, muscle weakness, and issues with sensation or coordination.</p>
<p>MS can take several forms, with new symptoms either appearing in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or gradually building up over time (progressive forms). In the relapsing forms of MS, symptoms may completely disappear between attacks, but some permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease progresses.</p>
<p>The cause of MS is still unclear, but it&rsquo;s believed to be due to the destruction by the immune system or failure of the cells that produce myelin, the insulating cover of nerve cells. Genetics and environmental factors, such as viral infections, are proposed causes. MS is usually diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms presented and the results of supporting medical tests.</p>
<h2 id="signs-and-symptoms">Signs and Symptoms <a href="#signs-and-symptoms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>A person with MS can experience almost any neurological symptom. The specific symptoms depend on the locations of the lesions (damaged areas) within the nervous system. These symptoms may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, such as tingling, pins and needles, or numbness; muscle weakness, blurred vision, pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination and balance; problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems, feeling tired, acute or chronic pain; and bladder and bowel difficulties.</p>
<p>When MS advances, walking difficulties can occur, and the risk of falling increases. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. The primary deficit in cognitive function that people with MS experience is slowed information-processing speed, with memory also commonly affected.</p>
<h3 id="prodromal-phase">Prodromal Phase <a href="#prodromal-phase" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>MS may have a prodromal phase in the years leading up to its manifestation, characterized by psychiatric issues, cognitive impairment, and increased use of healthcare.</p>
<h2 id="causes">Causes <a href="#causes" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The cause of MS is unknown, but it&rsquo;s believed to occur as a result of some combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as infectious agents.</p>
<h3 id="infectious-agents">Infectious Agents <a href="#infectious-agents" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS. One hypothesis is that infection by a widespread microbe contributes to disease development, and the geographic distribution of this organism influences the epidemiology of MS. Epstein-Barr herpes virus (EBV), which can cause infectious mononucleosis and infects about 95% of adults, has been linked to MS.</p>
<h3 id="genetics">Genetics <a href="#genetics" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>MS is not considered a Mendelian disease, as many, not just a few, genetic variations have been shown to increase the risk. MS has a polygenic architecture, meaning that many genetic variants of relatively small effect add together to produce an overall genetic predisposition for MS.</p>
<h3 id="geography">Geography <a href="#geography" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>MS is more common in people who live farther from the equator, although exceptions exist. These exceptions include ethnic groups that are at low risk and that live far from the equator such as the Sami, Amerindians, Canadian Hutterites, New Zealand MƒÅori, and Canada&rsquo;s Inuit, as well as groups that have a relatively high risk and that live closer to the equator such as Sardinians, inland Sicilians, Palestinians, and Parsi.</p>
<h3 id="other-factors-1">Other Factors <a href="#other-factors-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Smoking may be an independent risk factor for MS. Stress may be a risk factor, although the evidence to support this is weak. Association with occupational exposures and toxins‚Äîmainly organic solvents‚Äîhas been evaluated, but no clear conclusions have been reached. Vaccinations were studied as causal factors; most studies, though, show no association. Obesity during adolescence and young adulthood is a risk factor for MS.</p>
<h2 id="pathophysiology">Pathophysiology <a href="#pathophysiology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The three main characteristics of MS are the formation of lesions in the central nervous system (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons. These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of nerve tissue, and in turn, the signs and symptoms of the disease.</p>
<h3 id="lesions-1">Lesions <a href="#lesions-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The name multiple sclerosis refers to the scars (sclerae ‚Äì better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles.</p>
<h3 id="inflammation-1">Inflammation <a href="#inflammation-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Apart from demyelination, the other sign of the disease is inflammation. Fitting with an immunological explanation, the inflammatory process is caused by T cells, a kind of lymphocytes that plays an important role in the body&rsquo;s defenses.</p>
<h3 id="bloodbrain-barrier">Blood‚Äìbrain barrier <a href="#bloodbrain-barrier" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB) is a part of the capillary system that prevents the entry of T cells into the central nervous system. It may become permeable to these types of cells secondary to an infection by a virus or bacteria.</p>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis <a href="#diagnosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests. The diagnosis process can be complex as the symptoms of MS are similar to many other neurological conditions. Therefore, a thorough neurological examination and medical history are essential for diagnosis. This process may also involve a series of tests, including blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a spinal fluid analysis.</p>
<h2 id="treatment-and-management">Treatment and Management <a href="#treatment-and-management" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Currently, there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis. However, treatments are available that can help manage symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment strategies may include medication, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. Some people may also pursue alternative treatments, despite a lack of evidence of benefit.</p>
<p>The long-term outcome of MS is difficult to predict and varies greatly among individuals. Better outcomes are more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks.</p>

<h1 id="multiple-sclerosis-an-overview-1">Multiple Sclerosis: An Overview <a href="#multiple-sclerosis-an-overview-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a prevalent demyelinating disease that damages the protective covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting signal transmission in the nervous system. This disruption leads to various physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric symptoms, such as double vision, visual loss, muscle weakness, and issues with sensation or coordination. MS manifests in several forms, with symptoms either appearing in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or progressively building up over time. The cause of MS remains unclear, but it is believed to involve either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells. Potential causes include genetics and environmental factors like viral infections. Although no cure for MS exists, treatments aim to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. As of 2022, nearly one million people in the United States and about 2.8 million people globally have MS.</p>
<h1 id="symptoms-and-diagnosis-of-ms">Symptoms and Diagnosis of MS <a href="#symptoms-and-diagnosis-of-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>MS can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems. The specific symptoms depend on the locations of the lesions within the nervous system. Common symptoms include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, muscle weakness, blurred vision, pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems, fatigue, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties. Cognitive impairment and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. MS is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests.</p>
<h1 id="causes-and-risk-factors-of-ms">Causes and Risk Factors of MS <a href="#causes-and-risk-factors-of-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The cause of MS is unknown, but it is believed to occur as a result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as infectious agents. Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS. One hypothesis is that infection by a widespread microbe contributes to disease development, and the geographic distribution of this organism influences the epidemiology of MS. Epstein-Barr herpes virus (EBV) has been linked to MS, with compelling epidemiological and mechanistic evidence for a causal role of EBV in multiple sclerosis. MS is not considered a Mendelian disease, as many genetic variations have been shown to increase the risk. MS has a polygenic architecture, meaning that many genetic variants of relatively small effect add together to produce an overall genetic predisposition for MS. MS is more common in people who live farther from the equator, although exceptions exist. Other potential risk factors include smoking, stress, occupational exposures and toxins, vaccinations, diet, hormone intake, and obesity during adolescence and young adulthood.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-multiple-sclerosis-an-in-depth-analysis">Understanding Multiple Sclerosis: An In-Depth Analysis <a href="#understanding-multiple-sclerosis-an-in-depth-analysis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, often disabling disease that affects the central nervous system. It is the most common demyelinating disease, a term that refers to diseases that damage the protective covering of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, known as myelin. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to transmit signals, resulting in a range of symptoms that can include physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-multiple-sclerosis">Overview of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#overview-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MS can take several forms, with symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). In the relapsing forms of MS, symptoms may disappear completely between attacks, although some permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.</p>
<p>The cause of MS is unclear, but it is thought to involve either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells. Proposed causes for this include genetics and environmental factors, such as viral infections. MS is usually diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests.</p>
<p>There is no known cure for MS. Treatments aim to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. Physical therapy and occupational therapy can help with people&rsquo;s ability to function. Many people pursue alternative treatments, despite a lack of evidence of benefit.</p>
<p>The long-term outcome of MS is difficult to predict. Better outcomes are more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks.</p>
<h2 id="prevalence-of-multiple-sclerosis">Prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#prevalence-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MS is the most common immune-mediated disorder affecting the central nervous system. As of 2022, nearly one million people have MS in the United States. In 2020, about 2.8 million people were affected globally, with rates varying widely in different regions and among different populations. The disease usually begins between the ages of 20 and 50 and is twice as common in women as in men.</p>
<p>MS was first described in 1868 by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. The name &ldquo;multiple sclerosis&rdquo; is short for multiple cerebro-spinal sclerosis, which refers to the numerous glial scars (or sclerae ‚Äì essentially plaques or lesions) that develop on the white matter of the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<h2 id="signs-and-symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis">Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#signs-and-symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common. The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system.</p>
<p>These symptoms may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, such as tingling, pins and needles, or numbness; muscle weakness, blurred vision, pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain; and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as neurogenic bladder), among others.</p>
<p>When MS is more advanced, walking difficulties can occur and the risk of falling increases. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. The primary deficit in cognitive function that people with MS experience is slowed information-processing speed, with memory also commonly affected, and executive function less commonly. Intelligence, language, and semantic memory are usually preserved, and the level of cognitive impairment varies considerably between people with MS.</p>
<h2 id="prodromal-phase-of-multiple-sclerosis">Prodromal Phase of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#prodromal-phase-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MS may have a prodromal phase in the years leading up to MS manifestation, characterized by psychiatric issues, cognitive impairment, and increased use of healthcare. This phase can be considered as a period of subtle neurological changes that occur before the full-blown clinical presentation of MS.</p>
<h2 id="causes-of-multiple-sclerosis-1">Causes of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#causes-of-multiple-sclerosis-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The cause of MS is unknown, but it is believed to occur as a result of some combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as infectious agents. Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS, with one hypothesis suggesting that infection by a widespread microbe contributes to disease development, and the geographic distribution of this organism influences the epidemiology of MS.</p>
<h3 id="infectious-agents-and-multiple-sclerosis">Infectious Agents and Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#infectious-agents-and-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Two opposing versions of this hypothesis include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis, the former being more favored. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective; the disease is a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that an early, persistent, and silent infection increases risk of disease, thus the disease is more common where the infectious agent is more common.</p>
<p>Evidence for a virus as a cause include the presence of oligoclonal bands in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelinating encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections.</p>
<h3 id="genetics-and-multiple-sclerosis">Genetics and Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#genetics-and-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>MS is not considered a Mendelian disease, as many, not just a few, genetic variations have been shown to increase the risk. MS has a polygenic architecture, meaning that many genetic variants of relatively small effect add together to produce an overall genetic predisposition for MS.</p>
<p>The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related. An identical twin of an affected individual has a 30% chance of developing MS, 5% for a nonidentical twin, 2.5% for a sibling, and an even lower chance for a half sibling. If both parents are affected, the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population.</p>
<h3 id="geography-and-multiple-sclerosis">Geography and Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#geography-and-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>MS is more common in people who live farther from the equator, although exceptions exist. These exceptions include ethnic groups that are at low risk and that live far from the equator such as the Sami, Amerindians, Canadian Hutterites, New Zealand MƒÅori, and Canada&rsquo;s Inuit, as well as groups that have a relatively high risk and that live closer to the equator such as Sardinians, inland Sicilians, Palestinians, and Parsi.</p>
<p>The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While the north‚Äìsouth gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present. MS is more common in regions with northern European populations, so the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations.</p>
<h3 id="other-factors-and-multiple-sclerosis">Other Factors and Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#other-factors-and-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Smoking may be an independent risk factor for MS. Stress may be a risk factor, although the evidence to support this is weak. Association with occupational exposures and toxins‚Äîmainly organic solvents‚Äîhas been evaluated, but no clear conclusions have been reached. Vaccinations were studied as causal factors; most studies, though, show no association. Several other possible risk factors, such as diet and hormone intake, have been evaluated, but evidence on their relation with the disease is &ldquo;sparse and unpersuasive&rdquo;. Gout occurs less than would be expected and lower levels of uric acid have been found in people with MS. This has led to the theory that uric acid is protective, although its exact importance remains unknown. Obesity during adolescence and young adulthood is a risk factor for MS.</p>
<h2 id="pathophysiology-of-multiple-sclerosis">Pathophysiology of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#pathophysiology-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The three main characteristics of MS are the formation of lesions in the central nervous system (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons. These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of nerve tissue, and in turn, the signs and symptoms of the disease.</p>
<h3 id="lesions-in-multiple-sclerosis">Lesions in Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#lesions-in-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The name multiple sclerosis refers to the scars (sclerae ‚Äì better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles.</p>
<p>The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, and the rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved.</p>
<h3 id="inflammation-in-multiple-sclerosis">Inflammation in Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#inflammation-in-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Apart from demyelination, the other sign of the disease is inflammation. Fitting with an immunological explanation, the inflammatory process is caused by T cells, a kind of lymphocytes that plays an important role in the body&rsquo;s defenses.</p>
<h3 id="bloodbrain-barrier-and-multiple-sclerosis">Blood‚Äìbrain barrier and Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#bloodbrain-barrier-and-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB) is a part of the capillary system that prevents the entry of T cells into the central nervous system. It may become permeable to these types of cells secondary to an infection by a virus or bacteria. After it repairs itself, typically once the infection has cleared, T cells may remain trapped inside the brain.</p>
<h2 id="diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis">Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests. The diagnostic process can be complex and may require a variety of tests and procedures to rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis of MS. The diagnosis is often a process of exclusion, meaning that other potential causes of the symptoms the person is experiencing are ruled out before a definitive diagnosis of MS can be made.</p>
