It&rsquo;s so big that it&rsquo;s considered the largest religious structure in the world by the Guinness World Records! It was originally built as a Hindu temple for the god Vishnu by King Suryavarman II in the 12th century. But by the end of that century, it had slowly turned into a Buddhist temple. The modern name, Angkor Wat, means &ldquo;Temple City&rdquo; or &ldquo;City of Temples&rdquo; in the Khmer language.</p>
<h1 id="the-history-of-angkor-wat">The History of Angkor Wat <a href="#the-history-of-angkor-wat" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>King Suryavarman II built Angkor Wat in the early 12th century. It took 28 years to complete! The temple was dedicated to Vishnu, a Hindu god, and it was also the capital city of the Khmer Empire. After the king died, work on the temple stopped and some parts were left unfinished. Later, around 27 years after the king&rsquo;s death, the city of Angkor was attacked. A new king, Jayavarman VII, took over and changed the state temple to a Buddhist one, because he thought the Hindu gods had failed him. So, Angkor Wat also slowly changed into a Buddhist site.</p>

It&rsquo;s in a country called Cambodia, and it&rsquo;s a huge temple that covers an area of 162.6 hectares (that&rsquo;s about 200 football fields!). The people who keep track of world records say it&rsquo;s the largest religious building in the world.</p>
<p>The temple was first built as a Hindu temple for a god named Vishnu by a king named Suryavarman II in the 12th century. But towards the end of the century, it turned into a Buddhist temple. So, it&rsquo;s often called a &ldquo;Hindu-Buddhist&rdquo; temple. The name &lsquo;Angkor Wat&rsquo; means &ldquo;Temple City&rdquo; or &ldquo;City of Temples&rdquo; in the local language, Khmer.</p>
<h2 id="history">History <a href="#history" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Angkor Wat is located about 5.5 kilometers north of a modern town called Siem Reap. It was built by King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century. He asked a wise man named DivƒÅkarapa·πá·∏çita to help him build the temple. All the symbols and images in the temple come from Hinduism.</p>
<p>The temple was built as the king&rsquo;s state temple and capital city. But we don&rsquo;t know its original name because no documents or inscriptions have been found. Some people think it might have been called Vrah Vi·π£·πáuloka, which means &ldquo;the sacred dwelling of Vishnu&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After King Suryavarman II died, the temple was attacked by the Chams, who were enemies of the Khmer people. A new king, Jayavarman VII, then restored the empire and built a new capital and state temple dedicated to Buddhism. Because of this, Angkor Wat gradually turned into a Buddhist site, and many Hindu sculptures were replaced by Buddhist art.</p>
<h2 id="transformation-to-buddhism">Transformation to Buddhism <a href="#transformation-to-buddhism" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>By the end of the 12th century, Angkor Wat had become a Buddhist place of worship. Even though it was not well taken care of after the 16th century, it was never completely abandoned. There are records of Japanese Buddhist pilgrims living there in the 17th century. They thought the temple was a famous garden of the Buddha in India.</p>
<p>The first Western visitor to the temple was a Portuguese friar named Ant√≥nio da Madalena, who visited in 1586. He said that the temple was so extraordinary that it was impossible to describe it with a pen.</p>
<h2 id="rediscovery-and-restoration">Rediscovery and Restoration <a href="#rediscovery-and-restoration" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>In 1860, a French explorer named Henri Mouhot rediscovered the temple. He wrote about it in his travel notes, which made the site popular in the West. The beauty of Angkor Wat and other Khmer monuments in the region led to France taking control of Cambodia in 1863.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, a lot of work was done to restore Angkor Wat. Workers and archaeologists cleared away the jungle to reveal the beautiful stone structures of the temple. Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953 and has been in charge of Angkor Wat since then. The temple was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1992.</p>

It is designed to represent Mount Meru, the home of the gods in Hindu mythology. The temple has a series of rectangular galleries, each one higher than the last. In the center, there&rsquo;s a group of towers.</p>
<p>The temple is famous for its beautiful architecture, its detailed wall carvings, and the many statues of gods and goddesses that decorate its walls.</p>
<h3 id="style">Style <a href="#style" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Angkor Wat is a great example of the classical style of Khmer architecture. By the 12th century, Khmer architects had become very good at using sandstone for building. Most of the temple is made of sandstone blocks, while a type of clay called laterite was used for the outer wall and hidden parts.</p>
<p>The temple is praised for the harmony of its design. It has towers shaped like lotus buds, galleries that connect enclosures, and terraces that appear along the main axis of the temple. The temple also has many decorative elements like statues of gods and goddesses, bas-reliefs, pediments, garlands, and narrative scenes.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features <a href="#features" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><h4 id="outer-enclosure">Outer Enclosure <a href="#outer-enclosure" class="anchor">üîó</a></h4><p>The outer wall of Angkor Wat is surrounded by a wide moat. The temple can be accessed by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west. There are entrance towers at each of the four directions; the western one is the largest and has three ruined towers.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Angkor Wat is a magnificent temple that tells a story of history, culture, and religion. It is a symbol of Cambodia and a source of national pride. It&rsquo;s a place that everyone should know about because it helps us understand the world better.</p>

<h1 id="angkor-wat-overview">Angkor Wat Overview <a href="#angkor-wat-overview" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Angkor Wat, located in Cambodia, is a temple complex that spans 162.6 hectares or 402 acres, making it the largest religious structure in the world according to the Guinness World Records. The temple was originally built as a Hindu temple for the god Vishnu by King Suryavarman II during the 12th century for the Khmer Empire. However, by the end of the century, it gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple, which is why it is also referred to as a &ldquo;Hindu-Buddhist&rdquo; temple. The temple&rsquo;s design represents Mount Meru, a sacred mountain in Hindu mythology, and includes three rectangular galleries and a quincunx of towers at the center. Unlike most temples in the region, Angkor Wat faces west, a detail that has sparked scholarly debate about its significance.</p>
<h1 id="history-of-angkor-wat">History of Angkor Wat <a href="#history-of-angkor-wat" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The construction of Angkor Wat took place over 28 years, from 1122 to 1150 CE, during the reign of King Suryavarman II. The temple was built as the king&rsquo;s state temple and capital city, and it was dedicated to Vishnu, breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings. After the king&rsquo;s death, work on the temple seems to have ended, leaving some of the bas-relief decoration unfinished. In 1177, about 27 years after Suryavarman II&rsquo;s death, Angkor was sacked by the Chams, the traditional enemies of the Khmer. The empire was later restored by a new king, Jayavarman VII, who established a new capital and state temple dedicated to Buddhism, leading to the gradual conversion of Angkor Wat into a Buddhist site.</p>
<h1 id="architecture-of-angkor-wat-1">Architecture of Angkor Wat <a href="#architecture-of-angkor-wat-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Angkor Wat is a unique combination of the temple mountain and the later plan of concentric galleries, both fundamental elements of Khmer temple architecture. The temple&rsquo;s east-west orientation and lines of sight from terraces within the temple suggest a celestial significance. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level. Unlike most Khmer temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west, leading many to believe that it was intended to serve as Suryavarman II&rsquo;s funerary temple. The temple&rsquo;s design and arrangement of bas-reliefs suggest that the structure represents a claimed new era of peace under King Suryavarman II. Angkor Wat is considered the prime example of the classical style of Khmer architecture, praised for its harmony, power, unity, and style.</p>

<p>The construction of Angkor Wat was requested by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century. The temple was built in Ya≈õodharapura, the capital of the Khmer Empire, which is now known as Angkor. It was intended to serve as the king&rsquo;s state temple and eventual mausoleum.</p>
<p>The architecture of Angkor Wat combines two basic designs of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and the later galleried temple. The temple is designed to represent Mount Meru, which is considered the home of the gods in Hindu mythology.</p>

<h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context <a href="#historical-context" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Angkor Wat is located 5.5 kilometers north of the modern town of Siem Reap and a short distance south and slightly east of the previous capital, centered at Baphuon. It is the southernmost of Angkor&rsquo;s main sites in a region of Cambodia rich in ancient structures.</p>
<p>The temple&rsquo;s construction took place over 28 years from 1122 to 1150 CE during King Suryavarman II&rsquo;s reign. A brahmin named DivƒÅkarapa·πá·∏çita urged the king to construct the temple. All of the original religious motifs at Angkor Wat were derived from Hinduism, and the temple was dedicated to Vishnu, breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings.</p>
<p>In 1177, approximately 27 years after the death of Suryavarman II, Angkor was sacked by the Chams, traditional enemies of the Khmer. The empire was later restored by a new king, Jayavarman VII, who established a new capital and state temple (Angkor Thom and the Bayon, respectively), dedicated to Buddhism. Consequently, Angkor Wat was gradually converted into a Buddhist site.</p>
<h2 id="transition-to-buddhism-and-modern-discoveries">Transition to Buddhism and Modern Discoveries <a href="#transition-to-buddhism-and-modern-discoveries" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>By the end of the 12th century, Angkor Wat had transitioned from a Hindu center of worship to Buddhism, a practice that continues to the present day. Despite being largely neglected after the 16th century, the temple was never completely abandoned.</p>
<p>In the 17th century, Japanese Buddhist pilgrims established small settlements alongside Khmer locals, as evidenced by fourteen inscriptions found in the Angkor area. The temple was thought to be the famed Jetavana garden of the Buddha, originally located in the kingdom of Magadha, India.</p>
<p>The first Western visitor to the temple was Ant√≥nio da Madalena, a Portuguese friar who visited in 1586. His awe of the temple&rsquo;s extraordinary construction was profound, stating that it was &ldquo;like no other building in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The temple was effectively rediscovered in 1860 by French naturalist and explorer Henri Mouhot, who popularised the site in the West through the publication of his travel notes. His descriptions of Angkor Wat ignited interest in the Western world, leading to France adopting Cambodia as a protectorate in 1863 and taking control of the ruins.</p>
<h2 id="the-20th-century-and-beyond">The 20th Century and Beyond <a href="#the-20th-century-and-beyond" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The 20th century saw significant restoration of Angkor Wat, with teams of laborers and archaeologists exposing the expanses of stone, allowing sunlight to illuminate the temple&rsquo;s dark corners. The temple gained further attention when a life-size replica was displayed during the Paris Colonial Exposition in 1931.</p>
<p>Cambodia gained independence from France on November 9, 1953, and has controlled Angkor Wat since then. The temple was nominated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1992.</p>
<p>However, restoration work was interrupted by the Cambodian Civil War and Khmer Rouge control of the country during the 1970s and 1980s. Despite this, relatively little damage was done during this period. More damage was inflicted after the wars by art thieves working out of Thailand, who claimed almost every removable head from the structures, including reconstructions.</p>
<p>Angkor Wat remains a symbol of national pride for Cambodia, featuring on the national flag since its first introduction in 1863. The temple&rsquo;s importance has factored into Cambodia&rsquo;s diplomatic relations with France, the United States, and its neighbor Thailand.</p>
<p>In December 2015, a research team from the University of Sydney discovered a previously unseen ensemble of buried towers built and demolished during the construction of Angkor Wat. The findings suggest that the temple precinct, bounded by a moat and wall, may not have been used exclusively by the priestly elite, as was previously thought.</p>
<h2 id="architectural-highlights">Architectural Highlights <a href="#architectural-highlights" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Angkor Wat&rsquo;s architecture is a unique combination of the temple mountain and concentric galleries, most of which were originally derived from Hinduism. The temple&rsquo;s east-west orientation and specific lines of sight from terraces within the temple suggest celestial significance.</p>
<p>The temple&rsquo;s design represents Mount Meru, the home of the gods according to Hindu mythology. The central quincunx of towers symbolizes the mountain&rsquo;s five peaks, while the walls and moat symbolize the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.</p>
<p>The temple&rsquo;s main tower aligns with the morning sun of the spring equinox. Unlike most Khmer temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west, leading many to conclude that Suryavarman intended it to serve as his funerary temple.</p>
<p>The temple&rsquo;s design and arrangement of bas-reliefs suggest that the structure represents a claimed new era of peace under King Suryavarman II. This is a topic of interest and skepticism in academic circles.</p>
<h2 id="site-and-plan-2">Site and Plan <a href="#site-and-plan-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The temple&rsquo;s layout borrows elements from Chinese influence in its system of galleries, which join at right angles to form courtyards. However, the axial pattern embedded in the plan of Angkor Wat may be derived from Southeast Asian cosmology in combination with the mandala represented by the main temple.</p>
<h2 id="style-and-features">Style and Features <a href="#style-and-features" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Angkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of Khmer architecture, known as the Angkor Wat style. By the 12th century, Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of sandstone as the main building material. The temple is praised for the harmony of its design.</p>
<p>Architecturally, the temple is characterized by ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple.</p>
<p>The temple&rsquo;s outer wall is surrounded by a 30-meter apron of open ground and a moat over 5 kilometers in perimeter. Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west. There are gopuras (tower-like structures) at each of the cardinal points; the western one is the largest and has three ruined towers.</p>

This site spans an expansive area of 162.6 hectares or 1,626,000 m2, equivalent to approximately 402 acres. It holds the distinction of being the largest religious structure in the world, as recognized by the Guinness World Records.</p>
<p>The temple was initially constructed as a Hindu temple devoted to the god Vishnu during the 12th century under the reign of King Suryavarman II. However, towards the end of the century, it gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple, hence it is often referred to as a &ldquo;Hindu-Buddhist&rdquo; temple.</p>
<h2 id="historical-background">Historical Background <a href="#historical-background" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The construction of Angkor Wat was initiated by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century in Ya≈õodharapura, the capital of the Khmer Empire, which is present-day Angkor. The temple was built as the state temple and eventual mausoleum of the king.</p>
<p>The architectural design of Angkor Wat combines two fundamental plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and the later galleried temple. It symbolizes Mount Meru, the abode of the devas in Hindu mythology. The temple complex is surrounded by a moat that extends over 5 kilometers and an outer wall that is 3.6 kilometers long. Inside this enclosure are three rectangular galleries, each elevated above the next. At the center of the temple stands a quincunx of towers.</p>
<p>Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat faces west, a detail that has sparked scholarly debate regarding its significance. The temple is renowned for the grandeur and harmony of its architecture, its extensive bas-reliefs, and the numerous devatas adorning its walls.</p>
<p>The modern name Angkor Wat translates to &ldquo;Temple City&rdquo; or &ldquo;City of Temples&rdquo; in Khmer. The original name of the temple was Vrah Vi·π£·πáuloka or Parama Vi·π£·πáuloka, which means &ldquo;the sacred dwelling of Vishnu&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Arcology is a big word that means designing buildings to fit lots of people and be good for nature. The idea was made by an architect named Paolo Soleri in 1969. He thought these buildings could have homes, shops, and farms, while also being kind to the environment. This idea is mostly in books and hasn&rsquo;t been built yet. Some cities have tried to make buildings like this, like a project in Arizona and some in Tokyo and Shanghai. There&rsquo;s even a city being built in Saudi Arabia that&rsquo;s designed to have no cars or pollution!</p>

<h1 id="arcology-a-cool-idea-for-future-cities">Arcology: A Cool Idea for Future Cities! <a href="#arcology-a-cool-idea-for-future-cities" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p><strong>What is Arcology?</strong></p>
<p>Arcology is a big word that comes from two smaller words: &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; and &ldquo;ecology&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s an idea for designing cities that can hold a lot of people but are also kind to the environment. This idea was first thought of by a man named Paolo Soleri in 1969. He imagined cities that had homes, shops, farms, and everything else people need, all in one place. This way, we wouldn&rsquo;t harm nature as much. But, we haven&rsquo;t built a real city like this yet. Some of our favorite science fiction writers, like Larry Niven and William Gibson, have written about these kinds of cities in their books.</p>
<p><strong>How Would Arcology Work?</strong></p>
<p>An arcology city would be more than just a big building. It would be designed to use its own resources, like power and water, very wisely. It would also grow its own food and clean its own waste. This way, it wouldn&rsquo;t need to take too much from nature. Arcology cities would also have their own systems for things like transportation and commerce, so they could work well with other cities. The goal is to have a lot of people living comfortably in one place without using up too much of Earth&rsquo;s resources. Some people, like Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller, had similar ideas in the past, but they didn&rsquo;t exactly call it arcology.</p>
<p><strong>Arcology in Real Life and Fiction</strong></p>
<p>There are some places in the world that are trying to be a bit like arcology cities. For example, Arcosanti in Arizona is a project that&rsquo;s been going on since 1970. It&rsquo;s trying to show how an arcology city might work. Some other cities, like Tokyo and Dongtan near Shanghai, have also tried to use arcology ideas in their design. And even though we haven&rsquo;t built a full arcology city yet, we can see them in books and video games. In the game Sim City 2000, players can build their own arcology cities!</p>

<h1 id="understanding-arcology">Understanding Arcology <a href="#understanding-arcology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Hey kids! Have you ever heard of the word &lsquo;Arcology&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s a big word, but don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re going to break it down and make it easy to understand. Arcology is a mix of two words, &lsquo;architecture&rsquo; and &rsquo;ecology&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s all about designing buildings and cities in a way that allows lots of people to live together, but without harming our beautiful planet.</p>
<h2 id="the-idea-of-arcology">The Idea of Arcology <a href="#the-idea-of-arcology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The term &lsquo;Arcology&rsquo; was first used by an architect named Paolo Soleri in 1969. He thought that an arcology, a city built with these principles, would have spaces for homes, shops, and even farms, all while reducing the harm we cause to the environment. However, no such city has been built yet.</p>
<p>The idea of arcology has been used in many science fiction books. Authors like Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, and William Gibson have written about cities where each corporation has its own self-contained city known as arcologies.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-an-arcology-work">How Does an Arcology Work? <a href="#how-does-an-arcology-work" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>An arcology is different from a large building because it&rsquo;s designed to lessen the impact of people living on the environment. It could be self-sustainable, which means it uses its own resources to provide everything people need to live comfortably. This includes power, climate control, food production, air and water conservation and purification, sewage treatment, and more.</p>
<p>Arcologies were suggested to reduce the harm we cause to natural resources. They use regular building techniques in very large projects to make it easier for people to walk or bike instead of using cars.</p>
<h2 id="early-arcology-ideas">Early Arcology Ideas <a href="#early-arcology-ideas" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Frank Lloyd Wright, a famous architect, proposed an early version of an arcology called Broadacre City. It was different from an arcology because it was spread out and depended on roads. Critics said that Wright&rsquo;s idea didn&rsquo;t consider population growth and assumed a more rigid democracy than the US has.</p>
<p>Another architect, Buckminster Fuller, proposed a domed city for 125,000 people as a solution to housing problems in East St. Louis, Illinois. Paolo Soleri, who coined the term &lsquo;arcology&rsquo;, suggested ways of compacting city structures to save on transportation and other energy uses.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-arcology-projects">Real-World Arcology Projects <a href="#real-world-arcology-projects" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Arcosanti is an experimental &lsquo;arcology prototype&rsquo; under construction in central Arizona since 1970. It&rsquo;s designed by Paolo Soleri to demonstrate his personal designs and principles of arcology to create a pedestrian-friendly city.</p>
<p>There are many cities in the world like Tokyo and Dongtan near Shanghai that have proposed projects following the design principles of the arcology concept. The Antarctic research base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly 3,000 staff who visit each year. Its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character.</p>
<h2 id="arcology-in-popular-culture">Arcology in Popular Culture <a href="#arcology-in-popular-culture" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Most attempts to build real arcologies have failed due to financial, structural, or conceptual problems. Therefore, arcologies are mostly found in fictional works. In Robert Silverberg&rsquo;s The World Inside, most of the global population of 75 billion live inside giant skyscrapers, called &ldquo;urbmons&rdquo;, each of which contains hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>In the city-building video game Sim City 2000, self-contained arcologies can be built, reducing the infrastructure needs of the city.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>So, that&rsquo;s what &lsquo;Arcology&rsquo; is all about! It&rsquo;s a cool concept that combines architecture and ecology to create cities that can house a lot of people without harming the environment. It&rsquo;s a big idea that&rsquo;s been used in many science fiction books and even in video games. Who knows, maybe one day we might see a real arcology!</p>

<p>Arcology, a concept combining architecture and ecology, aims to create densely populated, ecologically friendly habitats. This idea, first proposed by Paolo Soleri in 1969, envisions structures that house residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities while minimizing environmental impact. However, no full-scale arcology has been built yet. The concept has been popular in science fiction and some real-world projects, like Arcosanti in Arizona and the proposed &ldquo;The Line&rdquo; in Saudi Arabia, have tried to apply these principles. Arcologies aim to be self-sufficient, using their own resources for power, food, and waste treatment, and reducing the impact on natural resources.</p>

It&rsquo;s a concept that involves designing buildings for densely populated areas in a way that minimally affects the environment. The term was first used in 1969 by an architect named Paolo Soleri. He believed that an arcology could house a variety of facilities such as homes, businesses, and farms, while also reducing the environmental impact of each person living there. However, no actual arcology has been built yet, despite Soleri&rsquo;s vision. The idea of arcologies has been used by many science fiction writers, who often depict them as self-contained or economically self-sufficient cities.</p>
<h1 id="development-and-real-world-projects">Development and Real-World Projects <a href="#development-and-real-world-projects" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>An arcology is different from just a large building because it&rsquo;s designed to lessen the impact of people living on the environment.

There have been similar real-world projects, like Arcosanti, an experimental project in Arizona designed by Soleri, and proposals for arcology-like designs in cities like Tokyo and Dongtan near Shanghai.</p>
<h1 id="arcology-in-popular-culture-and-future-prospects">Arcology in Popular Culture and Future Prospects <a href="#arcology-in-popular-culture-and-future-prospects" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Most attempts to build real arcologies have failed due to financial, structural, or conceptual problems. Because of this, arcologies are mostly found in fictional works. For example, in Robert Silverberg&rsquo;s book &ldquo;The World Inside&rdquo;, most of the world&rsquo;s population lives inside giant skyscrapers, each housing hundreds of thousands of people. All the inhabitants&rsquo; needs are provided inside the building, so going outside is considered crazy. In the video game Sim City 2000, players can build self-contained arcologies to reduce the infrastructure needs of the city. Despite the challenges, the concept of arcology continues to inspire architects and urban planners, and it remains a fascinating idea for a sustainable future.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-arcology">Introduction to Arcology <a href="#introduction-to-arcology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Arcology is a blend of two words: &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; and &ldquo;ecology&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a unique field that merges these two disciplines to create design principles for densely populated, yet environmentally friendly human habitats. The term was first introduced in 1969 by an architect named Paolo Soleri. He envisioned that a fully realized arcology would house various residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities, all while minimizing the environmental impact of its inhabitants. However, these structures have remained mostly theoretical, with no complete arcology yet built, even by Soleri himself.</p>
<p>The concept of arcology has been widely popularized in the realm of science fiction. Authors like Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, William Gibson, Peter Hamilton, and Paolo Bacigalupi have incorporated arcologies into their narratives. In these stories, arcologies are often depicted as self-contained or economically self-sufficient entities.</p>
<h1 id="development-of-arcology">Development of Arcology <a href="#development-of-arcology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>An arcology is not just a large building. It&rsquo;s a structure designed to lessen the environmental impact of human habitation. It aims to be self-sustainable, using all or most of its resources for a comfortable life, such as power, climate control, food production, air and water conservation and purification, sewage treatment, and more. An arcology is designed to supply these necessities for a large population, maintaining its own municipal or urban infrastructures to operate and connect with other urban environments.</p>
<p>Arcologies were proposed to reduce human impact on natural resources. Arcology designs might use conventional building and civil engineering techniques on a large scale to achieve economies of scale that are difficult to achieve post-automobile.</p>
<p>Notable figures like Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller proposed early versions of arcologies. Wright&rsquo;s proposal, called Broadacre City, was criticized for not accounting for population growth and assuming a more rigid democracy than the US has. Fuller proposed a domed city project called Old Man River&rsquo;s City as a solution to housing problems in East St. Louis, Illinois.</p>
<p>Paolo Soleri, who coined the term &ldquo;arcology&rdquo;, proposed later solutions. He described ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl and economize on transportation and other energy uses. Soleri advocated for greater &ldquo;frugality&rdquo; and favored greater use of shared social resources, including public transit and public libraries.</p>
<h1 id="similar-real-world-projects">Similar Real-World Projects <a href="#similar-real-world-projects" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>While no complete arcology has been built, there have been similar projects. Arcosanti, an experimental &ldquo;arcology prototype&rdquo;, has been under construction in central Arizona since 1970. Designed by Paolo Soleri, its primary purpose is to demonstrate Soleri&rsquo;s personal designs and his application of principles of arcology.</p>
<p>Several cities around the world, like Tokyo and Dongtan near Shanghai, have proposed projects that adhere to the design principles of the arcology concept. However, the Dongtan project may have collapsed and failed to open for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010.</p>
<p>McMurdo Station of the United States Antarctic Program and other scientific research stations on Antarctica resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically advanced, relatively self-sufficient human community. The Begich Towers in Whittier, Alaska, operates like a small-scale arcology, housing nearly all of the town&rsquo;s population and facilities.</p>
<p>The Line, a linear smart city under construction in Saudi Arabia, is designed to have no cars, streets, or carbon emissions. It is planned to be the first development in Neom, a $500 billion project, and anticipates a population of 9 million.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-arcology-1">Introduction to Arcology <a href="#introduction-to-arcology-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Arcology is a term that merges &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; and &ldquo;ecology.&rdquo; This field focuses on creating architectural design principles that cater to very densely populated and ecologically low-impact human habitats. The term was coined in 1969 by architect Paolo Soleri, who believed that a completed arcology would provide space for a variety of residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human environmental impact. However, these structures have remained largely hypothetical, as no arcology, even one envisioned by Soleri himself, has yet been built.</p>
<p>The concept of arcology has been popularized by various science fiction writers. Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle provided a detailed description of an arcology in their 1981 novel Oath of Fealty. William Gibson mainstreamed the term in his seminal 1984 cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, where each corporation has its own self-contained city known as arcologies. More recently, authors such as Peter Hamilton in Neutronium Alchemist and Paolo Bacigalupi in The Water Knife explicitly used arcologies as part of their scenarios. They are often portrayed as self-contained or economically self-sufficient.</p>
<h1 id="development-of-arcology-1">Development of Arcology <a href="#development-of-arcology-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>An arcology is distinguished from a merely large building in that it is designed to lessen the impact of human habitation on any given ecosystem. It could be self-sustainable, employing all or most of its own available resources for a comfortable life: power, climate control, food production, air and water conservation and purification, sewage treatment, etc. An arcology is designed to make it possible to supply those items for a large population. An arcology would supply and maintain its own municipal or urban infrastructures in order to operate and connect with other urban environments apart from its own.</p>
<p>Arcologies were proposed to reduce human impact on natural resources. Arcology designs might apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large, but practical projects in order to achieve pedestrian economies of scale that have proven, post-automobile, to be difficult to achieve in other ways.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright proposed an early version called Broadacre City although, in contrast to an arcology, his idea is comparatively two-dimensional and depends on a road network. Wright&rsquo;s plan described transportation, agriculture, and commerce systems that would support an economy. Critics said that Wright&rsquo;s solution failed to account for population growth, and assumed a more rigid democracy than the US actually has.</p>
<p>Buckminster Fuller proposed the Old Man River&rsquo;s City project, a domed city with a capacity of 125,000, as a solution to the housing problems in East St. Louis, Illinois. Paolo Soleri proposed later solutions, and coined the term &ldquo;arcology&rdquo;. Soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl, to economize on transportation and other energy uses. Like Wright, Soleri proposed changes in transportation, agriculture, and commerce. Soleri explored reductions in resource consumption and duplication, land reclamation; he also proposed to eliminate most private transportation. He advocated for greater &ldquo;frugality&rdquo; and favored greater use of shared social resources, including public transit (and public libraries).</p>

The Dongtan project may have collapsed, and it failed to open for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010.</p>
<p>McMurdo Station of the United States Antarctic Program and other scientific research stations on Antarctica resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically advanced, relatively self-sufficient human community. The Antarctic research base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly 3,000 staff who visit each year. Its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character. The station is not self-sufficient ‚Äì the U.S. military delivers 30,000 cubic metres (8,000,000 US gal) of fuel and 5 kilotonnes (11 million pounds) of supplies and equipment yearly through its Operation Deep Freeze resupply effort ‚Äì but it is isolated from conventional support networks. Under international treaty, it must avoid damage to the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
<p>Begich Towers operates like a small-scale arcology encompassing nearly all of the population of Whittier, Alaska. The building contains residential housing as well as a police station, grocery, and municipal offices. Whittier once boasted a second structure known as the Buckner Building. The Buckner Building still stands but was deemed unfit for habitation after the 1969 earthquake. The Line is a 170 kilometres (110 mi) long and 200 metres (660 ft) wide linear smart city under construction in Saudi Arabia in Neom, Tabuk Province, which is designed to have no cars, streets or carbon emissions. The Line is planned to be the first development in Neom, a $500 billion project. The city&rsquo;s plans anticipate a population of 9 million. Excavation work had started along the entire length of the project by October 2022.</p>
<h1 id="arcology-in-popular-culture-2">Arcology in Popular Culture <a href="#arcology-in-popular-culture-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Most proposals to build real arcologies have failed due to financial, structural or conceptual shortcomings.

<p>Bioluminescent bacteria are tiny organisms that can glow in the dark! They mostly live in the sea, but some can also be found on land and in freshwater. Some live on their own, while others live inside animals like the Hawaiian Bobtail squid. These bacteria give off light, which the animals can use for things like hiding from predators or attracting food. These bacteria also use their glow to communicate with each other when there are lots of them in one place. People have known about these glowing bacteria for a long time, even famous scientists like Aristotle and Charles Darwin wrote about them. We can learn a lot from these bacteria, like how to detect pollution in the environment.</p>

<h1 id="glowing-bacteria">Glowing Bacteria <a href="#glowing-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are special types of bacteria that can produce light. They are mostly found in the sea, on the seafloor, on dead fish, and inside sea animals. Some types of these bacteria can also live on land and in fresh water. These bacteria can live alone or with other animals, like the Hawaiian Bobtail squid. When they live with other animals, they get a safe home and enough food from their hosts. In return, they help their hosts by providing light which can be used for hiding, attracting food, or finding mates. These bacteria can also use their light to sense how many other bacteria are around them, which helps them control their genes.</p>
<h1 id="the-story-of-glowing-bacteria">The Story of Glowing Bacteria <a href="#the-story-of-glowing-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>People have known about bioluminescent bacteria for thousands of years. They are mentioned in stories from many different cultures, including Scandinavia and India. Even famous scientists like Aristotle and Charles Darwin have talked about the glow of the ocean. The glow is caused by an enzyme called luciferase. This enzyme was first studied in detail by scientists McElroy and Green in 1955. They found that luciferase is made of two parts, which they named Œ± and Œ≤. These parts are made by genes called luxA and luxB, which were first found in a type of bioluminescent bacteria called Aliivibrio fisheri.</p>
<h1 id="why-bacteria-glow">Why Bacteria Glow <a href="#why-bacteria-glow" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Bioluminescent bacteria use their glow in many ways. One of the main ways is to spread around. Some bacteria live in the guts of sea animals and get spread around when these animals poop. The glowing bacteria in the poop attract other animals, which eat the poop and help spread the bacteria even further. This glow helps the bacteria survive and spread to new hosts. The glow of bacteria is controlled by an enzyme called luciferase. When there are only a few bacteria, they make less luciferase to save energy. But when there are many bacteria, they make more luciferase and glow brighter. This is controlled by a process called quorum sensing, where the bacteria sense how many other bacteria are around them and adjust their glow accordingly.</p>

Some of them also live on land and in freshwater. These bacteria can live on their own or with other animals like the Hawaiian Bobtail squid or some worms. The animals give the bacteria a safe place to live and food to eat. In return, the bacteria make light that the animals use to hide, find food, or find mates. The bacteria can also use the light to communicate with each other when there are a lot of them in one place. This is called quorum sensing.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-the-history-of-bioluminescent-bacteria">Section 2: The History of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#section-2-the-history-of-bioluminescent-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>People have known about these glowing bacteria for a long time. Stories about them come from many parts of the world, including Scandinavia and India. Famous scientists like Aristotle and Charles Darwin wrote about the ocean glowing. Scientists have learned a lot about how these bacteria make light in the last 30 years. They discovered an enzyme called luciferase that is responsible for the light. The first scientists to purify luciferase were McElroy and Green in 1955. Later, scientists found out that luciferase is made up of two parts, called subunits Œ± and Œ≤. The genes for these parts, luxA and luxB, were first found in the bacteria Aliivibrio fisheri.</p>
<h2 id="section-3-why-do-bacteria-glow">Section 3: Why Do Bacteria Glow? <a href="#section-3-why-do-bacteria-glow" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>There are many reasons why living things make their own light. Some use it to find mates, scare away predators, or send warning signals. For bioluminescent bacteria, the light helps them spread to new places. Some bacteria live in the guts of sea animals. When the animals poop, the bacteria use their light to attract other animals who eat the poop and the bacteria inside it. This helps the bacteria survive and spread because they can live inside the new host.</p>
<h2 id="section-4-how-do-bacteria-control-their-glow">Section 4: How Do Bacteria Control Their Glow? <a href="#section-4-how-do-bacteria-control-their-glow" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Bacteria control their light with the help of luciferase. When there are not many bacteria around, they make less luciferase to save energy. This is controlled by a process called quorum sensing. The bacteria release special signaling molecules called autoinducers. When there are enough bacteria around, the autoinducers activate and tell the bacteria to make more luciferase. This leads to more light being produced.</p>
<h2 id="section-5-the-science-behind-the-glow">Section 5: The Science Behind the Glow <a href="#section-5-the-science-behind-the-glow" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The light comes from a chemical reaction that luciferase helps with. This reaction involves an organic molecule called luciferin. In the presence of oxygen, luciferase helps luciferin to react and produce light. Different organisms, like bacteria, insects, and dinoflagellates, have different types of luciferin-luciferase systems. For bioluminescent bacteria, the reaction involves the oxidation of an aliphatic aldehyde by a reduced flavin mononucleotide. The products of this reaction include an oxidized flavin mononucleotide, a fatty acid chain, and energy in the form of a blue-green visible light.</p>
<h2 id="section-6-the-evolution-of-bioluminescent-bacteria">Section 6: The Evolution of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#section-6-the-evolution-of-bioluminescent-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are the most common and diverse light-makers in the ocean. But they are not spread evenly, which suggests that they have adapted over time. Some bacteria on land, like Photorhabdus, make light. But not all bacteria in the ocean make light. For example, some species of Vibrio and Shewanella oneidensis do not make light. However, all light-making bacteria share a common gene sequence. This suggests that the ability to make light evolved as a way for the bacteria to survive in different environments.</p>
<h2 id="section-7-bioluminescent-bacteria-in-the-lab">Section 7: Bioluminescent Bacteria in the Lab <a href="#section-7-bioluminescent-bacteria-in-the-lab" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>After scientists discovered the lux operon, the set of genes responsible for light production, they started using bioluminescent bacteria in the lab. These bacteria can be used as biosensors to detect contaminants, measure the toxicity of pollutants, and monitor genetically engineered bacteria released into the environment. For example, Pseudomonas fluorescens has been genetically engineered to break down certain pollutants and is used as a biosensor to assess the availability of these pollutants.</p>
<h2 id="section-8-the-diversity-of-bioluminescent-bacteria">Section 8: The Diversity of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#section-8-the-diversity-of-bioluminescent-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>All bioluminescent bacteria belong to the families Vibrionaceae, Shewanellaceae, or Enterobacteriaceae. They are most abundant in marine environments during spring blooms when there are high nutrient concentrations. These bacteria can be found all over the world, living freely, with other organisms, or as opportunistic pathogens. Factors that affect where they live include temperature, salinity, nutrient concentration, pH level, and sunlight. For example, Aliivibrio fischeri likes temperatures between 5 and 30 ¬∞C and a pH less than 6.8, while Photobacterium phosphoreum prefers temperatures between 5 and 25 ¬∞C and a pH less than 7.0.</p>
<h2 id="section-9-genes-and-bioluminescence">Section 9: Genes and Bioluminescence <a href="#section-9-genes-and-bioluminescence" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>All bioluminescent bacteria share a common set of genes called the lux operon. This set of genes includes luxAB, which codes for luciferase, and luxCDE, which codes for a complex that makes aldehydes for the bioluminescent reaction. Despite this common set of genes, there are variations among species. Based on these differences, the lux operon can be divided into four types: the Aliivibrio/Shewanella type, the Photobacterium type, theVibrio/Candidatus Photodesmus type, and the Photorhabdus type.</p>

Some scientists think that the light helps the bacteria survive in low oxygen conditions. Others think that luciferase helps the bacteria deal with harmful oxygen compounds. Some even think that the light helps with DNA repair. Finally, some scientists believe that the light helps the bacteria attract predators who can help them spread to new places. While we don&rsquo;t know for sure, scientists are always discovering new things about these fascinating bacteria.</p>

<p>Bioluminescent bacteria, mostly found in the sea, produce light through a chemical reaction involving an enzyme called luciferase. Some of these bacteria live freely, while others live in symbiosis with animals, providing light for camouflage or attraction in exchange for a safe home and nutrition. This light production is also used for quorum sensing, a way to regulate gene expression based on bacterial cell density. Bioluminescent bacteria are also used as tools in laboratories for detecting contaminants and monitoring genetically engineered bacteria. Bioluminescence has evolved independently many times, suggesting a strong selective advantage despite its high energy cost.</p>

<h1 id="bioluminescent-bacteria-an-overview">Bioluminescent Bacteria: An Overview <a href="#bioluminescent-bacteria-an-overview" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are fascinating microorganisms that can produce light. They are mainly found in sea water, marine sediments, decomposing fish surfaces, and in the gut of marine animals. However, some can also be found in freshwater and on land. These bacteria may live freely or in symbiosis with animals. In symbiotic relationships, the host provides the bacteria with a safe home and nutrition, while the bacteria produce light that the host can use for camouflage or to attract prey or mates. Some bacteria may also use their light for quorum sensing, a way of regulating gene expression based on the density of the bacteria population.</p>
<h1 id="history-and-purpose-of-bioluminescence">History and Purpose of Bioluminescence <a href="#history-and-purpose-of-bioluminescence" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The existence of bioluminescent bacteria has been known for thousands of years, with records appearing in the folklore of many regions, including Scandinavia and the Indian subcontinent. Even Aristotle and Charles Darwin described the phenomenon of glowing oceans. The enzyme responsible for this light, luciferase, was first purified in 1955. This enzyme, along with its regulatory gene, lux, have led to significant advances in molecular biology. In the case of bioluminescent bacteria, the light they produce mainly serves as a form of dispersal, helping them survive and spread by attracting other organisms to ingest them.</p>
<h1 id="biochemistry-and-regulation-of-bioluminescence">Biochemistry and Regulation of Bioluminescence <a href="#biochemistry-and-regulation-of-bioluminescence" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The chemical reaction responsible for bioluminescence is catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase. In the presence of oxygen, luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of an organic molecule called luciferin, producing light. The regulation of bioluminescence in bacteria is achieved through the regulation of luciferase. Bacteria decrease the production of luciferase when their population is sparse to conserve energy. This regulation is done through a process called quorum sensing, where signaling molecules activate receptors when the bacteria population is dense enough, leading to a coordinated induction of luciferase production and visible luminescence.</p>
<h1 id="evolution-and-use-of-bioluminescent-bacteria">Evolution and Use of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#evolution-and-use-of-bioluminescent-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are the most abundant and diverse light emitters in the ocean, but their distribution is uneven, suggesting evolutionary adaptations. All bioluminescent bacteria share a common gene sequence, the lux operon, suggesting that bioluminescence in bacteria is a result of evolutionary adaptations. After the discovery of the lux operon, bioluminescent bacteria have been used as a laboratory tool in environmental microbiology for detecting contaminants, measuring pollutant toxicity, and monitoring genetically engineered bacteria released into the environment.</p>
<h1 id="bacterial-groups-exhibiting-bioluminescence">Bacterial Groups Exhibiting Bioluminescence <a href="#bacterial-groups-exhibiting-bioluminescence" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>All bacterial species reported to possess bioluminescence belong to the families Vibrionaceae, Shewanellaceae, or Enterobacteriaceae, all of which are assigned to the class Gammaproteobacteria. They are most abundant in marine environments during spring blooms when nutrient concentrations are high. Factors that affect their distribution include temperature, salinity, nutrient concentration, pH level, and solar radiation.</p>
<h1 id="genetic-diversity-and-mechanism-of-bioluminescence">Genetic Diversity and Mechanism of Bioluminescence <a href="#genetic-diversity-and-mechanism-of-bioluminescence" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Despite their diversity, all bioluminescent bacteria share a common gene sequence, the lux operon, which codes for the enzymes involved in the bioluminescent reaction. The reaction involves the oxidation of a reduced flavin mononucleotide and a long-chain aldehyde, producing water, a corresponding fatty acid, and light. Bioluminescence is an energetically expensive process, so it is only expressed when physiologically necessary.</p>
<h1 id="role-of-bioluminescent-bacteria">Role of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#role-of-bioluminescent-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The role and evolutionary history of bioluminescent bacteria remain largely mysterious.

Some studies suggest that the luminescence pathway can function as an alternate pathway for electron flow under low oxygen concentrations, and that luciferase contributes to resistance against oxidative stress. Another hypothesis suggests that bacterial bioluminescence attracts predators who assist in their dispersal.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-bioluminescent-bacteria">Introduction to Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#introduction-to-bioluminescent-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are fascinating microorganisms that have the unique ability to produce light. This feature is predominantly found in bacteria that live in sea water, marine sediments, on the surface of decomposing fish, and in the gut of marine animals. However, bacterial bioluminescence is not restricted to marine environments. Some terrestrial and freshwater bacteria also exhibit this characteristic.</p>
<p>These bacteria may live freely, like Vibrio harveyi, or they may live in symbiosis, which is a close and long-term biological interaction, with animals. Some of their animal partners include the Hawaiian Bobtail squid, which hosts Aliivibrio fischeri, and terrestrial nematodes, which host Photorhabdus luminescens.</p>
<p>In these symbiotic relationships, the host organisms provide the bacteria with a safe home and sufficient nutrition. In return, the hosts use the light produced by the bacteria for various purposes such as camouflage, attracting prey, and/or attracting mates. This mutual benefit is a hallmark of a successful symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>Another reason bacteria might use luminescence is for quorum sensing. This is an ability to regulate gene expression in response to bacterial cell density. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to coordinate their behaviors based on their population size.</p>
<h1 id="history-of-bioluminescent-bacteria">History of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#history-of-bioluminescent-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The existence of bioluminescent bacteria has been known for thousands of years. They appear in the folklore of many regions, including Scandinavia and the Indian subcontinent. Even famous scientists like Aristotle and Charles Darwin have described the phenomenon of the oceans glowing.</p>
<p>The enzyme responsible for this glow, luciferase, was discovered less than 30 years ago. This discovery, along with the identification of its regulatory gene, lux, has led to significant advances in molecular biology. Luciferase was first purified by McElroy and Green in 1955. Later, it was discovered that luciferase is composed of two subunits, referred to as subunits Œ± and Œ≤. The genes encoding these enzymes, luxA and luxB, were first isolated in the lux operon of Aliivibrio fisheri.</p>
<h1 id="purpose-of-bioluminescence">Purpose of Bioluminescence <a href="#purpose-of-bioluminescence" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Bioluminescence serves a variety of biological purposes. It can be used for attracting mates, defending against predators, and sending warning signals. For bioluminescent bacteria, bioluminescence mainly serves as a form of dispersal.</p>
<p>It has been hypothesized that enteric bacteria, which survive in the guts of other organisms, employ bioluminescence as an effective form of distribution. These bacteria can make their way into the digestive tracts of fish and other marine organisms and be excreted in fecal pellets. The bacteria then use their bioluminescent capabilities to attract other organisms and prompt ingestion of these bacterial-containing fecal pellets. This ensures their survival, persistence, and dispersal as they are able to enter and inhabit other organisms.</p>
<h1 id="regulation-of-bioluminescence">Regulation of Bioluminescence <a href="#regulation-of-bioluminescence" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The regulation of bioluminescence in bacteria is achieved through the regulation of the enzyme luciferase. When the population of bioluminescent bacteria is sparse, it&rsquo;s important for the bacteria to decrease production rates of luciferase to conserve energy.</p>
<p>This regulation is achieved by a form of chemical communication referred to as quorum sensing. Certain signaling molecules, named autoinducers, interact with specific bacterial receptors. These receptors become activated when the population density of bacteria is high enough, leading to a coordinated induction of luciferase production that ultimately yields visible luminescence.</p>
<h1 id="biochemistry-of-bioluminescence">Biochemistry of Bioluminescence <a href="#biochemistry-of-bioluminescence" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The chemical reaction responsible for bioluminescence is catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase. In the presence of oxygen, luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of an organic molecule called luciferin.</p>
<p>While bioluminescence across a diverse range of organisms, such as bacteria, insects, and dinoflagellates, generally function in this manner, there are different types of luciferin-luciferase systems. For bacterial bioluminescence specifically, the biochemical reaction involves the oxidation of an aliphatic aldehyde by a reduced flavin mononucleotide. The products of this oxidation reaction include an oxidized flavin mononucleotide, a fatty acid chain, and energy in the form of a blue-green visible light.</p>
<h1 id="evolution-of-bioluminescence">Evolution of Bioluminescence <a href="#evolution-of-bioluminescence" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are the most abundant and diverse light emitters in the ocean. However, their distribution is uneven, which suggests that they have undergone evolutionary adaptations. For example, the bacterial species in terrestrial genera such as Photorhabdus are bioluminescent, while marine genera with bioluminescent species such as Vibrio and Shewanella oneidensis have closely related species that do not emit light.</p>
<p>Despite these differences, all bioluminescent bacteria share a common gene sequence: the enzymatic oxidation of Aldehyde and reduced Flavin mononucleotide by luciferase, which are contained in the lux operon. This identical gene sequence suggests that bioluminescent bacteria result from evolutionary adaptations.</p>
<h1 id="use-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-as-a-laboratory-tool">Use of Bioluminescent Bacteria as a Laboratory Tool <a href="#use-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-as-a-laboratory-tool" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>After the discovery of the lux operon, the use of bioluminescent bacteria as a laboratory tool has revolutionized the area of environmental microbiology. Bioluminescent bacteria can be used as biosensors for detection of contaminants, measurement of pollutant toxicity, and monitoring of genetically engineered bacteria released into the environment.</p>
<p>Biosensors can be used to determine the concentration of specific pollutants. They can also distinguish between pollutants that are bioavailable and those that are inert and unavailable. For example, Pseudomonas fluorescens has been genetically engineered to be capable of degrading salicylate and naphthalene, and is used as a biosensor to assess the bioavailability of these substances. Biosensors can also be used as an indicator of cellular metabolic activity and to detect the presence of pathogens.</p>
<h1 id="evolution-of-bioluminescent-bacteria">Evolution of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#evolution-of-bioluminescent-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The chemistry behind bioluminescence varies across the lineages of bioluminescent organisms. Based on this observation, bioluminescence is believed to have evolved independently at least 40 times.</p>
<p>Among bacteria, the distribution of bioluminescent species is polyphyletic, meaning that the trait has appeared in multiple, unrelated lineages. For instance, while all species in the terrestrial genus Photorhabdus are luminescent, the genera Aliivibrio, Photobacterium, Shewanella and Vibrio contain both luminous and non-luminous species.</p>
<p>Despite bioluminescence in bacteria not sharing a common origin, they all share a common gene sequence. The appearance of the highly conserved lux operon in bacteria from very different ecological niches suggests a strong selective advantage despite the high energetic costs of producing light.</p>
<p>DNA repair is thought to be the initial selective advantage for light production in bacteria. Consequently, the lux operon may have been lost in bacteria that evolved more efficient DNA repair systems but retained in those where visible light became a selective advantage. The evolution of quorum sensing is believed to have afforded further selective advantage for light production. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to conserve energy by ensuring that they do not synthesize light-producing chemicals unless a sufficient concentration are present to be visible.</p>
<h1 id="bacterial-groups-that-exhibit-bioluminescence">Bacterial Groups that Exhibit Bioluminescence <a href="#bacterial-groups-that-exhibit-bioluminescence" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>All bacterial species that have been reported to possess bioluminescence belong within the families Vibrionaceae, Shewanellaceae, or Enterobacteriaceae, all of which are assigned to the class Gammaproteobacteria.</p>
<h1 id="distribution-of-bioluminescent-bacteria">Distribution of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#distribution-of-bioluminescent-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are most abundant in marine environments during spring blooms when there are high nutrient concentrations. These light-emitting organisms are found mainly in coastal waters near the outflow of rivers.</p>
<p>Bioluminescent bacteria are also found in freshwater and terrestrial environments but are less widespread than in seawater environments. They are found globally, as free-living, symbiotic or parasitic forms, and possibly as opportunistic pathogens.</p>
<p>Factors that affect the distribution of bioluminescent bacteria include temperature, salinity, nutrient concentration, pH level, and solar radiation. For example, Aliivibrio fischeri grows favorably in environments that have temperatures between 5 and 30 ¬∞C and a pH that is less than 6.8; whereas, Photobacterium phosphoreum thrives in conditions that have temperatures between 5 and 25 ¬∞C and a pH that is less than 7.0.</p>
<h1 id="genetic-diversity-of-bioluminescent-bacteria">Genetic Diversity of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#genetic-diversity-of-bioluminescent-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>All bioluminescent bacteria share a common gene sequence: the lux operon characterized by the luxCDABE gene organization. LuxAB codes for luciferase while luxCDE codes for a fatty-acid reductase complex that is responsible for synthesizing aldehydes for the bioluminescent reaction.</p>
<p>Despite this common gene organization, variations, such as the presence of other lux genes, can be observed among species. Based on similarities in gene content and organization, the lux operon can be organized into the following four distinct types: the Aliivibrio/Shewanella type, the Photobacterium type, the Vibrio/Candidatus Photodesmus type, and the Photorhabdus type.</p>
<h1 id="mechanism-of-bioluminescence">Mechanism of Bioluminescence <a href="#mechanism-of-bioluminescence" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>All bacterial luciferases are approximately 80 KDa heterodimers containing two subunits: Œ± and Œ≤. The Œ± subunit is responsible for light emission. The luxA and luxB genes encode for the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits, respectively.</p>
<p>The bioluminescent reaction is as follows: FMNH2 + O2 + R-CHO -&gt; FMN + H2O + R-COOH + Light (~ 495 nm). Molecular oxygen reacts with FMNH2 (reduced flavin mononucleotide) and a long-chain aldehyde to produce FMN (flavin mononucleotide), water and a corresponding fatty acid. The blue-green light emission of bioluminescence, such as that produced by Photobacterium phosphoreum and Vibro harveyi, results from this reaction.</p>
<p>Because light emission involves expending six ATP molecules for each photon, it is an energetically expensive process. For this reason, light emission is not constitutively expressed in bioluminescent bacteria; it is expressed only when physiologically necessary.</p>
<h1 id="quorum-sensing">Quorum Sensing <a href="#quorum-sensing" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Bioluminescence in bacteria can be regulated through a phenomenon known as autoinduction or quorum sensing. Quorum sensing is a form of cell-to-cell communication that alters gene expression in response to cell density.</p>
<p>Autoinducer is a diffusible pheromone produced constitutively by bioluminescent bacteria and serves as an extracellular signalling molecule. When the concentration of autoinducer secreted by bioluminescent cells in the environment reaches a threshold (above 107 cells per mL), it induces the expression of luciferase and other enzymes involved in bioluminescence.</p>
<p>Bacteria are able to estimate their density by sensing the level of autoinducer in the environment and regulate their bioluminescence such that it is expressed only when there is a sufficiently high cell population. A sufficiently high cell population ensures that the bioluminescence produced by the cells will be visible in the environment.</p>
<h1 id="role-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-1">Role of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#role-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The uses of bioluminescence and its biological and ecological significance for animals, including host organisms for bacteria symbiosis, have been widely studied. The biological role and evolutionary history for specifically bioluminescent bacteria still remains quite mysterious and unclear.</p>
<p>However, there are continually new studies being done to determine the impacts that bacterial bioluminescence can have on our constantly changing environment and society. Scientists have begun to explore new ways of incorporating bioluminescent bacteria into urban light sources to reduce the need for electricity. They have also begun to use bioluminescent bacteria as a form of art and urban design.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown the biochemical roles of the luminescence pathway. It can function as an alternate pathway for electron flow under low oxygen concentration, which can be advantageous when no fermentable substrate is available.</p>
<p>Evidence also suggests that bacterial luciferase contributes to the resistance of oxidative stress. In laboratory culture, luxA and luxB mutants of Vibrio harveyi, which lacked luciferase activity, showed impairment of growth under high oxidative stress compared to wild type. This suggests that luciferase mediates the detoxification of reactive oxygen.</p>
<p>Bacterial bioluminescence has also been proposed to be a source of internal light in photoreactivation, a DNA repair process carried out by photolyase. Experiments have shown that non-luminescent V. harveyi mutants are more sensitive to UV irradiation, suggesting the existence of a bioluminescent-mediated DNA repair system.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis, called the ‚Äúbait hypothesis‚Äù, is that bacterial bioluminescence attracts predators who will assist in their dispersal. They are either directly ingested by fish or indirectly ingested by zooplankton.</p>

<p>Bioluminescent bacteria, predominantly found in marine environments, produce light through the oxidation of an organic molecule catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase. This light production aids in camouflage, prey attraction, and mate attraction for their host organisms. The bacteria also use light for quorum sensing, a form of communication that regulates gene expression in response to bacterial cell density. Bioluminescent bacteria have evolved symbiotic relationships with other organisms and have been used as a tool in environmental microbiology for detecting contaminants and monitoring genetically engineered bacteria. The lux operon, a common gene sequence in all bioluminescent bacteria, is believed to have evolved due to strong selective advantages.</p>

<h1 id="bioluminescent-bacteria-an-in-depth-overview">Bioluminescent Bacteria: An In-depth Overview <a href="#bioluminescent-bacteria-an-in-depth-overview" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are bacteria that produce light and are predominantly found in sea water, marine sediments, the surface of decomposing fish, and in the gut of marine animals.

In return, the hosts use the light produced by the bacteria for various purposes such as camouflage, prey, and/or mate attraction.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-2">History of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#history-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Records of bioluminescent bacteria have been around for thousands of years, appearing in the folklore of many regions, including Scandinavia and the Indian subcontinent. Notable figures like Aristotle and Charles Darwin have described the phenomenon of the oceans glowing. The enzyme luciferase and its regulatory gene, lux, which were discovered less than 30 years ago, have led to significant advances in molecular biology. Luciferase was first purified by McElroy and Green in 1955. Subsequently, it was discovered that there were two subunits to luciferase, called subunits Œ± and Œ≤. The genes encoding these enzymes, luxA and luxB, respectively, were first isolated in the lux operon of Aliivibrio fischeri.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-bioluminescence-1">Purpose of Bioluminescence <a href="#purpose-of-bioluminescence-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Bioluminescence serves a variety of biological purposes, including but not limited to the attraction of mates, defense against predators, and warning signals. In the case of bioluminescent bacteria, bioluminescence primarily serves as a form of dispersal. It has been hypothesized that enteric bacteria, especially those prevalent in the depths of the ocean, employ bioluminescence as an effective form of distribution. After entering the digestive tracts of fish and other marine organisms and being excreted in fecal pellets, bioluminescent bacteria utilize their bioluminescent capabilities to attract other organisms and prompt ingestion of these bacterial-containing fecal pellets. This ensures their survival, persistence, and dispersal as they are able to enter and inhabit other organisms.</p>
<h2 id="regulation-of-bioluminescence-1">Regulation of Bioluminescence <a href="#regulation-of-bioluminescence-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The regulation of bioluminescence in bacteria is achieved through the regulation of the oxidative enzyme called luciferase. It is crucial for bioluminescent bacteria to decrease production rates of luciferase when the population is sparse in order to conserve energy. Thus, bacterial bioluminescence is regulated by means of chemical communication referred to as quorum sensing. Certain signaling molecules named autoinducers with specific bacterial receptors become activated when the population density of bacteria is high enough. The activation of these receptors leads to a coordinated induction of luciferase production that ultimately yields visible luminescence.</p>
<h2 id="biochemistry-of-bioluminescence-2">Biochemistry of Bioluminescence <a href="#biochemistry-of-bioluminescence-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The chemical reaction responsible for bioluminescence is catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase. In the presence of oxygen, luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of an organic molecule called luciferin. Although bioluminescence across a diverse range of organisms such as bacteria, insects, and dinoflagellates functions in this general manner (utilizing luciferase and luciferin), there are different types of luciferin-luciferase systems. For bacterial bioluminescence specifically, the biochemical reaction involves the oxidation of an aliphatic aldehyde by a reduced flavin mononucleotide. The products of this oxidation reaction include an oxidized flavin mononucleotide, a fatty acid chain, and energy in the form of a blue-green visible light.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-of-bioluminescence-2">Evolution of Bioluminescence <a href="#evolution-of-bioluminescence-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are the most abundant and diverse light emitters in the ocean. However, the distribution of bioluminescent bacteria is uneven, suggesting evolutionary adaptations. The bacterial species in terrestrial genera such as Photorhabdus are bioluminescent. On the other hand, marine genera with bioluminescent species such as Vibrio and Shewanella oneidensis have different closely related species that are not light emitters. Nevertheless, all bioluminescent bacteria share a common gene sequence: the enzymatic oxidation of Aldehyde and reduced Flavin mononucleotide by luciferase which are contained in the lux operon. Bacteria from distinct ecological niches contain this gene sequence; therefore, the identical gene sequence evidently suggests that bioluminescence bacteria result from evolutionary adaptations.</p>
<h3 id="use-as-laboratory-tool">Use as Laboratory Tool <a href="#use-as-laboratory-tool" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>After the discovery of the lux operon, the use of bioluminescent bacteria as a laboratory tool is claimed to have revolutionized the area of environmental microbiology. The applications of bioluminescent bacteria include biosensors for detection of contaminants, measurement of pollutant toxicity, and monitoring of genetically engineered bacteria released into the environment. Biosensors, created by placing a lux gene construct under the control of an inducible promoter, can be used to determine the concentration of specific pollutants. Biosensors are also able to distinguish between pollutants that are bioavailable and those that are inert and unavailable. For example, Pseudomonas fluorescens has been genetically engineered to be capable of degrading salicylate and naphthalene, and is used as a biosensor to assess the bioavailability of salicylate and naphthalene. Biosensors can also be used as an indicator of cellular metabolic activity and to detect the presence of pathogens.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-1">Evolution of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#evolution-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The chemistry behind bioluminescence varies across the lineages of bioluminescent organisms. Based on this observation, bioluminescence is believed to have evolved independently at least 40 times. In bioluminescent bacteria, the reclassification of the members of Vibrio fischeri species group as a new genus, Aliivibrio, has led to increased interest in the evolutionary origins of bioluminescence. Among bacteria, the distribution of bioluminescent species is polyphyletic. For instance, while all species in the terrestrial genus Photorhabdus are luminescent, the genera Aliivibrio, Photobacterium, Shewanella, and Vibrio contain both luminous and non-luminous species. Despite bioluminescence in bacteria not sharing a common origin, they all share a gene sequence in common. The appearance of the highly conserved lux operon in bacteria from very different ecological niches suggests a strong selective advantage despite the high energetic costs of producing light. DNA repair is thought to be the initial selective advantage for light production in bacteria. Consequently, the lux operon may have been lost in bacteria that evolved more efficient DNA repair systems but retained in those where visible light became a selective advantage. The evolution of quorum sensing is believed to have afforded further selective advantage for light production. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to conserve energy by ensuring that they do not synthesize light-producing chemicals unless a sufficient concentration are present to be visible.</p>
<h2 id="bacterial-groups-that-exhibit-bioluminescence-1">Bacterial Groups that Exhibit Bioluminescence <a href="#bacterial-groups-that-exhibit-bioluminescence-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>All bacterial species that have been reported to possess bioluminescence belong within the families Vibrionaceae, Shewanellaceae, or Enterobacteriaceae, all of which are assigned to the class Gammaproteobacteria.</p>
<h3 id="distribution-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-1">Distribution of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#distribution-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are most abundant in marine environments during spring blooms when there are high nutrient concentrations. These light-emitting organisms are found mainly in coastal waters near the outflow of rivers, such as the northern Adriatic Sea, Gulf of Trieste, northwestern part of the Caspian Sea, coast of Africa, and many more. These are known as milky seas. Bioluminescent bacteria are also found in freshwater and terrestrial environments but are less widespread than in seawater environments. They are found globally, as free-living, symbiotic, or parasitic forms and possibly as opportunistic pathogens. Factors that affect the distribution of bioluminescent bacteria include temperature, salinity, nutrient concentration, pH level, and solar radiation. For example, Aliivibrio fischeri grows favorably in environments that have temperatures between 5 and 30 ¬∞C and a pH that is less than 6.8; whereas, Photobacterium phosphoreum thrives in conditions that have temperatures between 5 and 25 ¬∞C and a pH that is less than 7.0.</p>
<h2 id="genetic-diversity-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-1">Genetic Diversity of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#genetic-diversity-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>All bioluminescent bacteria share a common gene sequence: the lux operon characterized by the luxCDABE gene organization. LuxAB codes for luciferase while luxCDE codes for a fatty-acid reductase complex that is responsible for synthesizing aldehydes for the bioluminescent reaction. Despite this common gene organization, variations, such as the presence of other lux genes, can be observed among species. Based on similarities in gene content and organization, the lux operon can be organized into the following four distinct types: the Aliivibrio/Shewanella type, the Photobacterium type, the Vibrio/Candidatus Photodesmus type, and the Photorhabdus type. While this organization follows the genera classification level for members of Vibrionaceae (Aliivibrio, Photobacterium, and Vibrio), its evolutionary history is not known. With the exception of the Photorhabdus operon type, all variants of the lux operon contain the flavin reductase-encoding luxG gene. Most of the Aliivibrio/Shewanella type operons contain additional luxI/luxR regulatory genes that are used for autoinduction during quorum sensing. The Photobacterium operon type is characterized by the presence of rib genes that code for riboflavin and forms the lux-rib operon. The Vibrio/Candidatus Photodesmus operon type differs from both the Aliivibrio/Shewanella and the Photobacterium operon types in that the operon has no regulatory genes directly associated with it.</p>
<h2 id="mechanism-of-bioluminescence-1">Mechanism of Bioluminescence <a href="#mechanism-of-bioluminescence-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>All bacterial luciferases are approximately 80 KDa heterodimers containing two subunits: Œ± and Œ≤. The Œ± subunit is responsible for light emission. The luxA and luxB genes encode for the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits, respectively. In most bioluminescent bacteria, the luxA and luxB genes are flanked upstream by luxC and luxD and downstream by luxE. The bioluminescent reaction is as follows: FMNH2 + O2 + R-CHO -&gt; FMN + H2O + R-COOH + Light (~ 495 nm). Molecular oxygen reacts with FMNH2 (reduced flavin mononucleotide) and a long-chain aldehyde to produce FMN (flavin mononucleotide), water, and a corresponding fatty acid. The blue-green light emission of bioluminescence, such as that produced by Photobacterium phosphoreum and Vibro harveyi, results from this reaction. Because light emission involves expending six ATP molecules for each photon, it is an energetically expensive process. For this reason, light emission is not constitutively expressed in bioluminescent bacteria; it is expressed only when physiologically necessary.</p>
<h3 id="quorum-sensing-1">Quorum Sensing <a href="#quorum-sensing-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Bioluminescence in bacteria can be regulated through a phenomenon known as autoinduction or quorum sensing. Quorum sensing is a form of cell-to-cell communication that alters gene expression in response to cell density. Autoinducer is a diffusible pheromone produced constitutively by bioluminescent bacteria and serves as an extracellular signaling molecule. When the concentration of autoinducer secreted by bioluminescent cells in the environment reaches a threshold, it induces the expression of luciferase and other enzymes involved in bioluminescence. Bacteria are able to estimate their density by sensing the level of autoinducer in the environment and regulate their bioluminescence such that it is expressed only when there is a sufficiently high cell population. A sufficiently high cell population ensures that the bioluminescence produced by the cells will be visible in the environment.</p>
<h2 id="role-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-3">Role of Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#role-of-bioluminescent-bacteria-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The uses of bioluminescence and its biological and ecological significance for animals, including host organisms for bacteria symbiosis, have been widely studied. The biological role and evolutionary history for specifically bioluminescent bacteria still remains quite mysterious and unclear. However, new studies are continually being done to determine the impacts that bacterial bioluminescence can have on our constantly changing environment and society. Aside from the many scientific and medical uses, scientists have also recently begun to come together with artists and designers to explore new ways of incorporating bioluminescent bacteria, as well as bioluminescent plants, into urban light sources to reduce the need for electricity. They have also begun to use bioluminescent bacteria as a form of art and urban design for the wonder and enjoyment of human society.</p>
<p>One explanation for the role of bacterial bioluminescence is from the biochemical aspect. Several studies have shown the biochemical roles of the luminescence pathway. It can function as an alternate pathway for electron flow under low oxygen concentration, which can be advantageous when no fermentable substrate is available. In this process, light emission is a side product of the metabolism.</p>
<p>Evidence also suggests that bacterial luciferase contributes to the resistance of oxidative stress. In laboratory culture, luxA and luxB mutants of Vibrio harveyi, which lacked luciferase activity, showed impairment of growth under high oxidative stress compared to wild type. The luxD mutants, which had an unaffected luciferase but were unable to produce luminescence, showed little or no difference. This suggests that luciferase mediates the detoxification of reactive oxygen.</p>
<p>Bacterial bioluminescence has also been proposed to be a source of internal light in photoreactivation, a DNA repair process carried out by photolyase. Experiments have shown that non-luminescent V. harveyi mutants are more sensitive to UV irradiation, suggesting the existence of a bioluminescent-mediated DNA repair system.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis, called the ‚Äúbait hypothesis‚Äù, is that bacterial bioluminescence attracts predators who will assist in their dispersal. They are either directly ingested by fish or indirectly ingested by zooplankton.</p>

<h1 id="bioluminescent-bacteria">Bioluminescent Bacteria <a href="#bioluminescent-bacteria" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are a fascinating group of organisms that have the ability to produce light. They are primarily found in seawater, marine sediments, the surface of decomposing fish, and the gut of marine animals. However, they can also be found in terrestrial and freshwater environments, albeit less commonly.

Terrestrial bacterial species such as Photorhabdus are bioluminescent, while marine genera with bioluminescent species such as Vibrio and Shewanella oneidensis have closely related species that do not emit light.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all bioluminescent bacteria share a common gene sequence: the enzymatic oxidation of aldehyde and reduced flavin mononucleotide by luciferase, which are contained in the lux operon. Bacteria from distinct ecological niches contain this gene sequence, suggesting that bioluminescent bacteria are the result of evolutionary adaptations.</p>
<h2 id="use-as-a-laboratory-tool">Use as a Laboratory Tool <a href="#use-as-a-laboratory-tool" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The discovery of the lux operon has led to the use of bioluminescent bacteria as a revolutionary tool in environmental microbiology. Applications include biosensors for the detection of contaminants, measurement of pollutant toxicity, and monitoring of genetically engineered bacteria released into the environment.</p>
<p>Biosensors, created by placing a lux gene construct under the control of an inducible promoter, can be used to determine the concentration of specific pollutants. They can also differentiate between pollutants that are bioavailable and those that are inert and unavailable. For example, Pseudomonas fluorescens has been genetically engineered to degrade salicylate and naphthalene and is used as a biosensor to assess the bioavailability of these substances. Biosensors can also be used as an indicator of cellular metabolic activity and to detect the presence of pathogens.</p>
<h2 id="evolution">Evolution <a href="#evolution" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Bioluminescence is believed to have evolved independently at least 40 times, as evidenced by the diverse chemistry behind light production across different lineages of bioluminescent organisms. The reclassification of the members of the Vibrio fischeri species group as a new genus, Aliivibrio, has led to increased interest in the evolutionary origins of bioluminescence.</p>
<p>The distribution of bioluminescent species among bacteria is polyphyletic. For instance, while all species in the terrestrial genus Photorhabdus are luminescent, the genera Aliivibrio, Photobacterium, Shewanella, and Vibrio contain both luminous and non-luminous species. Despite the lack of a common origin for bioluminescence in bacteria, they all share a common gene sequence.</p>
<p>The presence of the highly conserved lux operon in bacteria from very different ecological niches suggests a strong selective advantage despite the high energetic costs of producing light. DNA repair is thought to be the initial selective advantage for light production in bacteria. Consequently, the lux operon may have been lost in bacteria that evolved more efficient DNA repair systems but retained in those where visible light became a selective advantage. The evolution of quorum sensing is believed to have provided further selective advantage for light production, as it allows bacteria to conserve energy by ensuring that they do not synthesize light-producing chemicals unless a sufficient concentration is present to be visible.</p>
<h2 id="bacterial-groups-that-exhibit-bioluminescence-2">Bacterial Groups that Exhibit Bioluminescence <a href="#bacterial-groups-that-exhibit-bioluminescence-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>All bacterial species reported to possess bioluminescence belong within the families Vibrionaceae, Shewanellaceae, or Enterobacteriaceae, all of which are assigned to the class Gammaproteobacteria.</p>
<h2 id="distribution">Distribution <a href="#distribution" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Bioluminescent bacteria are most abundant in marine environments during spring blooms when there are high nutrient concentrations. These light-emitting organisms are primarily found in coastal waters near the outflow of rivers, such as the northern Adriatic Sea, Gulf of Trieste, northwestern part of the Caspian Sea, coast of Africa, and many more.</p>
<p>These areas are known as milky seas. Bioluminescent bacteria are also found in freshwater and terrestrial environments but are less widespread than in seawater environments. They are found globally, as free-living, symbiotic or parasitic forms, and possibly as opportunistic pathogens. Factors that affect the distribution of bioluminescent bacteria include temperature, salinity, nutrient concentration, pH level, and solar radiation.</p>
<p>For example, Aliivibrio fischeri grows favorably in environments that have temperatures between 5 and 30 ¬∞C and a pH that is less than 6.8; whereas, Photobacterium phosphoreum thrives in conditions that have temperatures between 5 and 25 ¬∞C and a pH that is less than 7.0.</p>
<h2 id="genetic-diversity">Genetic Diversity <a href="#genetic-diversity" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>All bioluminescent bacteria share a common gene sequence: the lux operon characterized by the luxCDABE gene organization. LuxAB codes for luciferase while luxCDE codes for a fatty-acid reductase complex that is responsible for synthesizing aldehydes for the bioluminescent reaction. Despite this common gene organization, variations, such as the presence of other lux genes, can be observed among species.</p>
<p>Based on similarities in gene content and organization, the lux operon can be organized into the following four distinct types: the Aliivibrio/Shewanella type, the Photobacterium type, the Vibrio/Candidatus Photodesmus type, and the Photorhabdus type. While this organization follows the genera classification level for members of Vibrionaceae (Aliivibrio, Photobacterium, and Vibrio), its evolutionary history is not known.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Photorhabdus operon type, all variants of the lux operon contain the flavin reductase-encoding luxG gene. Most of the Aliivibrio/Shewanella type operons contain additional luxI/luxR regulatory genes that are used for autoinduction during quorum sensing. The Photobacterium operon type is characterized by the presence of rib genes that code for riboflavin, and forms the lux-rib operon. The Vibrio/Candidatus Photodesmus operon type differs from both the Aliivibrio/Shewanella and the Photobacterium operon types in that the operon has no regulatory genes directly associated with it.</p>
<h2 id="mechanism">Mechanism <a href="#mechanism" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>All bacterial luciferases are approximately 80 KDa heterodimers containing two subunits: Œ± and Œ≤. The Œ± subunit is responsible for light emission. The luxA and luxB genes encode for the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits, respectively. In most bioluminescent bacteria, the luxA and luxB genes are flanked upstream by luxC and luxD and downstream by luxE.</p>
<p>The bioluminescent reaction is as follows: FMNH2 + O2 + R-CHO -&gt; FMN + H2O + R-COOH + Light (~ 495 nm). In this reaction, molecular oxygen reacts with FMNH2 (reduced flavin mononucleotide) and a long-chain aldehyde to produce FMN (flavin mononucleotide), water, and a corresponding fatty acid. The blue-green light emission of bioluminescence, such as that produced by Photobacterium phosphoreum and Vibro harveyi, results from this reaction.</p>
<p>Because light emission involves expending six ATP molecules for each photon, it is an energetically expensive process. For this reason, light emission is not constitutively expressed in bioluminescent bacteria; it is expressed only when physiologically necessary.</p>
<h2 id="quorum-sensing-2">Quorum Sensing <a href="#quorum-sensing-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Bioluminescence in bacteria can be regulated through a phenomenon known as autoinduction or quorum sensing. Quorum sensing is a form of cell-to-cell communication that alters gene expression in response to cell density. Autoinducer is a diffusible pheromone produced constitutively by bioluminescent bacteria and serves as an extracellular signaling molecule.</p>
<p>When the concentration of autoinducer secreted by bioluminescent cells in the environment reaches a threshold (above 107 cells per mL), it induces the expression of luciferase and other enzymes involved in bioluminescence. Bacteria are able to estimate their density by sensing the level of autoinducer in the environment and regulate their bioluminescence such that it is expressed only when there is a sufficiently high cell population. A sufficiently high cell population ensures that the bioluminescence produced by the cells will be visible in the environment.</p>
<h2 id="role">Role <a href="#role" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The uses of bioluminescence and its biological and ecological significance for animals, including host organisms for bacteria symbiosis, have been widely studied. The biological role and evolutionary history for specifically bioluminescent bacteria still remains quite mysterious and unclear.</p>
<p>However, there are continually new studies being done to determine the impacts that bacterial bioluminescence can have on our constantly changing environment and society. Aside from the many scientific and medical uses, scientists have also recently begun to come together with artists and designers to explore new ways of incorporating bioluminescent bacteria, as well as bioluminescent plants, into urban light sources to reduce the need for electricity. They have also begun to use bioluminescent bacteria as a form of art and urban design for the wonder and enjoyment of human society.</p>
<p>One explanation for the role of bacterial bioluminescence is from the biochemical aspect. Several studies have shown the biochemical roles of the luminescence pathway. It can function as an alternate pathway for electron flow under low oxygen concentration, which can be advantageous when no fermentable substrate is available. In this process, light emission is a side product of the metabolism.</p>
<p>Evidence also suggests that bacterial luciferase contributes to the resistance of oxidative stress. In laboratory culture, luxA and luxB mutants of Vibrio harveyi, which lacked luciferase activity, showed impairment of growth under high oxidative stress compared to wild type. The luxD mutants, which had an unaffected luciferase but were unable to produce luminescence, showed little or no difference. This suggests that luciferase mediates the detoxification of reactive oxygen.</p>
<p>Bacterial bioluminescence has also been proposed to be a source of internal light in photoreactivation, a DNA repair process carried out by photolyase. Experiments have shown that non-luminescent V. harveyi mutants are more sensitive to UV irradiation, suggesting the existence of a bioluminescent-mediated DNA repair system. Another hypothesis, called the ‚Äúbait hypothesis‚Äù, is that bacterial bioluminescence attracts predators who will assist in their dispersal. They are either directly ingested by fish or indirectly ingested by zooplankton.</p>

These organizations stated that even if Bonsai Kitten was a spoof, it &ldquo;encourages animal cruelty&rdquo;. The website&rsquo;s feature on cruel.com was highly controversial and was promptly removed. Initial statements from the humane society condemning the website as &ldquo;encouraging abuse&rdquo; instigated local investigations and an FBI announcement that they would investigate the hoax. The FBI&rsquo;s investigation was supported by animal activists but criticized by web authorities. The controversy surrounding the website led to its displacement, finding a new ISP twice before being permanently hosted on Rotten.com servers. The website still exists on some mirrors and continues to receive complaints from animal activists.

<p>A camera obscura is a dark room or box with a small hole that lets light in. The light forms a picture of what&rsquo;s outside on the opposite wall or a screen. It&rsquo;s like a very simple camera. People used it long ago to study things like the sun and to help them draw pictures. It works because light travels in straight lines. It&rsquo;s a bit like how our eyes work. The picture it makes is upside down and backwards, but you can use mirrors to flip it right way up.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-camera-obscura">Understanding Camera Obscura <a href="#understanding-camera-obscura" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>A camera obscura is like a dark room with a tiny hole or lens on one side. When light from the outside passes through this hole, it projects an image onto the wall or table on the opposite side. It&rsquo;s a bit like when you&rsquo;re in a dark room and you see a beam of light coming in through a small gap in the curtains. This idea was used to create the first photographic cameras. It was also used to safely study solar eclipses and as a tool to help artists draw and paint with accurate perspective.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-it-work">How Does It Work? <a href="#how-does-it-work" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Light travels in straight lines. When it hits an object, it bounces off and carries information about the object&rsquo;s color and brightness. If there is a small hole in a barrier, only the light rays that are moving straight towards the hole can get through. These rays create an image of the scene on the other side of the barrier. This is how our eyes work too! They have an opening (the pupil), a lens, and a surface where the image is formed (the retina). Some camera obscuras use a mirror to help focus the image, just like the lens in our eyes.</p>
<h1 id="the-design-of-camera-obscura">The Design of Camera Obscura <a href="#the-design-of-camera-obscura" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>A camera obscura can be a box, a tent, or a room. It has a small hole on one side or the top. Light from outside goes through the hole and hits a surface inside. This creates a picture of the outside scene. The picture is upside-down and backwards, but it still has all the colors and looks 3D. To make a clear picture, the hole has to be really small. If the hole is too small, though, the picture gets blurry. That&rsquo;s why camera obscuras usually use a lens instead of a hole. The lens lets in more light and keeps the picture clear. If the picture is projected onto a see-through screen, you can look at it from the back. This makes the picture right-side-up again. You can also use mirrors to flip the picture.</p>

But it&rsquo;s actually a simple thing. Imagine a very dark room with a tiny hole in one of the walls. Light from outside comes through this hole and projects an image onto the opposite wall. This is a Camera Obscura! The name comes from Latin and means &lsquo;dark chamber&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a room. A Camera Obscura can also be a box or a tent. The important thing is that it&rsquo;s dark inside with a small hole or lens for light to come in.</p>
<p>These special dark rooms or boxes have been used for a long time, even before the invention of the camera. Artists used them to help them draw and paint. They could trace the image projected inside the Camera Obscura to create very accurate drawings.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people also used the Camera Obscura to look at things that could hurt their eyes, like a solar eclipse. The image inside the Camera Obscura is safe to look at, even when the real thing isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-a-camera-obscura-work">How Does a Camera Obscura Work? <a href="#how-does-a-camera-obscura-work" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Light travels in straight lines. When it hits an object, it bounces off in all directions. But only the light rays that travel straight into the hole of the Camera Obscura can get inside.</p>
<p>These light rays form an image on the wall opposite the hole. It&rsquo;s a bit like how our eyes work. Our eyes have an opening (the pupil), a lens, and a surface where the image is formed (the retina).</p>
<p>The image in a Camera Obscura is upside-down and reversed. This happens because light travels in straight lines. The light from the top of an object has to travel downwards to get through the hole and onto the bottom of the opposite wall. The same thing happens with the light from the bottom of the object, it travels upwards through the hole and onto the top of the opposite wall. This flips the image upside down.</p>
<p>The image is also reversed because the light from the right side of the object ends up on the left side of the image and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="the-technology-of-a-camera-obscura">The Technology of a Camera Obscura <a href="#the-technology-of-a-camera-obscura" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>A Camera Obscura can be a box, a tent, or a room. The important thing is that it has a small hole in one side or the top. Light from outside comes through this hole and creates an image on a surface inside.</p>
<p>The hole needs to be small to create a clear image. If the hole is too big, the image becomes blurry. But if the hole is too small, the image becomes dim.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a lens is used instead of a hole. This allows more light to come in while still keeping the image clear.</p>
<p>The image inside a Camera Obscura is usually viewed on a flat surface like a wall or a table. But it can also be projected onto a translucent screen. If you look at the image from the back of the screen, it&rsquo;s no longer reversed, but it&rsquo;s still upside-down.</p>
<p>Mirrors can be used to flip the image right-side-up. In the 18th century, some Camera Obscuras used a periscope with mirrors to project an upright image onto the top of a tent.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-of-the-camera-obscura">The History of the Camera Obscura <a href="#the-history-of-the-camera-obscura" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Camera Obscura has a long history. Some people think that it might have inspired prehistoric cave paintings. The distortions in the shapes of animals in these paintings might have been caused by a Camera Obscura effect.</p>
<p>The earliest written records of a Camera Obscura come from ancient China and Greece. In the 4th century BC, a Chinese philosopher wrote about how light passing through a small hole forms an inverted image.</p>
<p>In the 11th century, an Arab physicist named Ibn al-Haytham studied the Camera Obscura in detail. He understood how the size of the hole affects the image and how light forms a cone shape inside the Camera Obscura.</p>
<p>The Camera Obscura was used in many different ways throughout history. It was used to study light, to make astronomical observations, and even for entertainment.</p>
<p>In the 15th century, the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci wrote a clear description of the Camera Obscura. He explained how an image of a sunlit building could be projected onto a piece of paper inside a dark room. This was a big step towards the invention of the photographic camera.</p>
<h2 id="the-camera-obscura-today">The Camera Obscura Today <a href="#the-camera-obscura-today" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Today, we have cameras that can take pictures instantly. But the Camera Obscura is still a fun and interesting way to learn about light and images. It&rsquo;s like a magic trick that&rsquo;s actually science!</p>
<p>So, why not try making your own Camera Obscura? You can use a shoebox, some aluminum foil, and a piece of white paper. Cut a small hole in one side of the box, cover it with the foil, and make a tiny pinhole in the foil. Put the paper on the inside of the opposite side of the box. Look inside the box through another hole, and you&rsquo;ll see an image projected onto the paper. It&rsquo;s a fun project that can help you understand how light works!</p>

<p>A camera obscura is a dark room or box with a small hole or lens that projects an image onto a surface inside. It was used as an aid for drawing and painting and to study eclipses safely. The concept was developed into the photographic camera in the 19th century. The human eye works similarly to a camera obscura. The camera obscura projects an image that is upside-down and reversed, but with color and perspective preserved. The sharpness of the image depends on the size of the hole.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-the-camera-obscura">Understanding the Camera Obscura <a href="#understanding-the-camera-obscura" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The camera obscura is a darkened room, box, or tent with a small hole or lens on one side that projects an image onto a surface on the opposite side. The term &ldquo;camera obscura&rdquo; comes from Latin and means &lsquo;dark chamber&rsquo;. This device has been used since the second half of the 16th century as a tool for drawing and painting. The image it projects is a highly accurate representation of the scene outside, making it useful for studying things like solar eclipses without risking eye damage. The camera obscura concept eventually evolved into the photographic camera in the 19th century. Before the term &ldquo;camera obscura&rdquo; was used in 1604, other terms like &ldquo;cubiculum obscurum&rdquo; and &ldquo;locus obscurus&rdquo; were used to describe the device.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-a-camera-obscura-work-1">How Does a Camera Obscura Work? <a href="#how-does-a-camera-obscura-work-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The camera obscura works on the principle that light travels in straight lines and changes when it hits an object. The light from the scene outside enters the camera obscura through a small hole, projecting an image on a surface inside. This image is inverted (upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but still retains color and perspective. The human eye functions in a similar way to a camera obscura, with the pupil acting as the opening, the lens focusing the light, and the retina forming the image. Some camera obscuras use a concave mirror to achieve a focusing effect similar to a convex lens.</p>
<h1 id="the-evolution-of-the-camera-obscura">The Evolution of the Camera Obscura <a href="#the-evolution-of-the-camera-obscura" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The camera obscura has been used throughout history for various purposes. In prehistoric times, it is thought that the camera obscura effect may have inspired cave paintings. The device&rsquo;s ability to project images was also used in ancient Chinese and Arab cultures to tell the time of day and year. The camera obscura was further developed in the Byzantine-Greek era, where it was used to study light. In the 11th century, Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham studied the camera obscura extensively and provided the first experimental and mathematical analysis of the phenomenon. Over time, the camera obscura became an important tool in the study of optics and light, influencing the work of many philosophers and scientists, including Leonardo da Vinci, Johannes Kepler, and Roger Bacon. Today, the principles of the camera obscura are still used in modern photography and imaging technology.</p>

It describes a darkened room with a small hole or lens on one side. Through this hole, an image from the outside is projected onto a wall or table on the other side. This concept is similar to how our eyes work, with light coming in through a small opening (the pupil), being focused by a lens, and forming an image on a surface (the retina).</p>
<p>The camera obscura is not just limited to a room. It can also be a box or a tent where an image from the outside is projected inside. These devices have been used since the 16th century, especially as tools for drawing and painting, as they allow artists to trace the projected image, creating a highly accurate representation. This was particularly useful for achieving the correct perspective in drawings.</p>
<p>Before the term &ldquo;camera obscura&rdquo; was first used in 1604, there were other terms to describe these devices, such as &ldquo;cubiculum obscurum&rdquo;, &ldquo;cubiculum tenebricosum&rdquo;, &ldquo;conclave obscurum&rdquo;, and &ldquo;locus obscurus&rdquo;. A camera obscura without a lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a pinhole camera. This term is also used to describe simple, homemade lensless cameras that use photographic film or photographic paper.</p>
<h2 id="physical-explanation">Physical Explanation <a href="#physical-explanation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>To understand how a camera obscura works, we need to understand how light behaves. Rays of light travel in straight lines and change when they are reflected and partly absorbed by an object. This reflection retains information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lighted objects reflect rays of light in all directions.</p>
<p>When a small enough opening is made in a barrier, only the rays that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side can pass through. These rays form an image of that scene where they reach a surface opposite from the opening. This is similar to how our eyes work, with the pupil acting as the opening, the lens focusing the light, and the retina being the surface where the image is formed. Some camera obscuras use a concave mirror to achieve a focusing effect similar to a convex lens.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology <a href="#technology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>A camera obscura can be a box, tent, or room with a small hole in one side or the top. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced. However, the image is inverted (upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and perspective preserved.</p>
<p>To produce a clear projected image, the aperture (the hole) is typically smaller than 1/100th the distance to the screen. As the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but also dimmer. If the pinhole is too small, the sharpness worsens due to diffraction (the bending of light waves around obstacles).</p>
<p>Camera obscuras usually use a lens rather than a pinhole because it allows a larger aperture, giving a usable brightness while maintaining focus. If the image is caught on a translucent screen, it can be viewed from the back so that it is no longer reversed (but still upside-down). Using mirrors, it is possible to project a right-side-up image.</p>

The concept of camera obscura can also extend to structures like a box or tent that project an external image inside. These devices have been in use since the latter half of the 16th century, primarily as aids for drawing and painting. The concept was further developed into the photographic camera in the first half of the 19th century. The camera obscura was also used to study solar eclipses safely and as a drawing aid, allowing artists to trace projected images for accurate representation, particularly in achieving correct graphical perspective.</p>
<h1 id="the-science-behind-camera-obscura">The Science Behind Camera Obscura <a href="#the-science-behind-camera-obscura" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Camera obscura operates on the principle that light travels in straight lines and changes when reflected and partially absorbed by an object, retaining information about the object&rsquo;s color and brightness. A small enough hole in a barrier only admits rays of light that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side, forming an image of that scene where they reach a surface opposite the opening. The human eye functions much like a camera obscura, with an opening (pupil), a convex lens, and a surface where the image is formed (retina).

<h1 id="introduction-3">Introduction <a href="#introduction-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The camera obscura, a term derived from Latin for &lsquo;dark chamber&rsquo;, is a simple device that has played a crucial role in the development of both art and science. It is essentially a darkened room or box with a small hole or lens on one side.

The 18th-century overhead version in tents used mirrors inside a kind of periscope on the top of the tent.

<p>The Chandrayaan programme is a series of space missions by India to explore the Moon. They use different types of spacecraft like orbiters, landers, and rovers. The first mission, Chandrayaan-1, found water on the Moon! The second mission, Chandrayaan-2, tried to land a rover on the Moon but it didn&rsquo;t work out. However, the orbiter is still working and collecting data. Chandrayaan-3, the third mission, aims to successfully land a rover on the Moon and do science experiments. Future missions, Chandrayaan-4 and Chandrayaan-5, will collect and analyze samples from the Moon&rsquo;s surface. Chandrayaan-6 even plans to bring samples back to Earth!</p>

<h1 id="chandrayaan-programme">Chandrayaan Programme <a href="#chandrayaan-programme" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The Chandrayaan Programme is like a big space adventure planned by India. It&rsquo;s a series of missions to explore the Moon, just like you might explore a new playground or park. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the team behind these missions. They use special spacecrafts like orbiters, impactors, soft landers, and rovers to study the Moon. Imagine these as different types of space cars, each with its own special job!</p>
<h2 id="the-missions">The Missions <a href="#the-missions" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Chandrayaan Programme is not just one trip, but many! The first mission sent an orbiter and an impactor probe to the Moon. It&rsquo;s like throwing a ball (the impactor) from a car (the orbiter) to see what happens. They found something amazing - water on the Moon! The second mission, launched in 2019, had an orbiter, a soft lander, and a rover. It&rsquo;s like having a car, a soft cushion to land, and a little robot to explore. The lander didn&rsquo;t work as planned, but the orbiter is still studying the Moon. There are plans for more missions, including Chandrayaan-3, which was launched in 2023.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans <a href="#future-plans" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Chandrayaan Programme has big plans for the future. They want to send more missions to the Moon to learn even more. One mission, called Chandrayaan-4, might happen in 2025 with help from Japan. This mission will have a lander and a rover to collect and study samples from the Moon, just like a scientist in a lab. Another mission, Chandrayaan-5, might happen between 2025 and 2030. This mission will drill into the Moon&rsquo;s soil to study it. It&rsquo;s like digging in the sand to see what&rsquo;s below. There are even plans for a mission to bring samples back to Earth, like bringing back a cool rock from a trip. These are all exciting plans for the future of space exploration!</p>

<h1 id="the-chandrayaan-programme">The Chandrayaan Programme <a href="#the-chandrayaan-programme" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The Chandrayaan Programme, also known as the Indian Lunar Exploration Programme, is a series of missions to outer space. These missions are led by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The programme includes different types of spacecraft like lunar orbiter, impactor, soft lander, and rover.</p>
<h2 id="programme-structure">Programme Structure <a href="#programme-structure" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Chandrayaan Programme is a multiple mission programme. This means it has many different parts. As of September 2019, one orbiter with an impactor probe has been sent to the Moon. This was done using ISRO&rsquo;s PSLV rocket. The second spacecraft, which included an orbiter, soft lander and rover, was launched on 22 July 2019. This was done using a LVM-3 rocket. There are plans for more missions in the Chandrayaan Programme, including Chandrayaan-3. The Chandrayaan-3 mission was launched in 14 July 2023 and is expected to reach the Moon&rsquo;s surface in August.</p>
<h3 id="phase-i-orbiter-and-impactor">Phase I: Orbiter and Impactor <a href="#phase-i-orbiter-and-impactor" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The first part of the Chandrayaan Programme was called Chandrayaan-1. This was announced by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on 15 August 2003. The mission was a big step forward for India&rsquo;s space program. The idea of an Indian mission to the Moon was first suggested in 1999 during a meeting of the Indian Academy of Sciences. The Astronautical Society of India took this idea forward in 2000. Soon after, ISRO set up a group called the National Lunar Mission Task Force. This group concluded that ISRO has the skills needed to carry out an Indian mission to the Moon. In April 2003, over 100 top Indian scientists in different fields discussed and approved the idea to launch an Indian probe to the Moon. Six months later, in November, the Indian government gave the go-ahead for the mission. Chandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008 aboard a PSLV-XL rocket. This mission discovered water on the Moon.</p>
<h3 id="phase-ii-soft-landers-and-rovers">Phase II: Soft landers and rovers <a href="#phase-ii-soft-landers-and-rovers" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The second part of the Chandrayaan Programme was called Chandrayaan-2. This was approved by the First Manmohan Singh Cabinet on 18 September 2008. Although ISRO was ready with the payload for Chandrayaan-2, the mission was postponed because Russia was unable to develop the lander on time. When Russia said they could not provide the lander even by 2015, India decided to develop the lunar mission independently. Chandrayaan-2 was launched on 22 July 2019 aboard a LVM3 rocket. The spacecraft was successfully put into lunar orbit on August 20, 2019. However, the lander was lost while attempting to land on 6 September 2019. The orbiter is still operational and collecting scientific data. It is expected to work for 7.5 years.</p>
<p>The next mission, Chandrayaan-3, was launched on 14 July 2023. This mission aims to show a successful and controlled landing on the lunar surface. It also intends to show the mobility of a rover on the Moon&rsquo;s terrain and to carry out scientific experiments directly on the lunar surface.</p>
<h3 id="phase-iii-on-site-sampling">Phase III: On site sampling <a href="#phase-iii-on-site-sampling" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The next mission will be the Lunar Polar Exploration Mission or Chandrayaan-4, which is suggested to be launched in 2025. India is working with Japan on this mission. This mission will be a lander-rover mission near the lunar pole to perform on site sampling and analysis of collected lunar material and demonstrate lunar night survival technologies.</p>
<p>Another mission, Chandrayaan-5, has been suggested for the time frame of 2025-30. This mission will include a lander based rotary-percussive drilling in lunar soil up to a depth of 1~1.5 meters and analysis of the soil using instruments. A volcanically and tectonically active area on the near side of the Moon will be selected for this experiment.</p>
<h3 id="phase-iv-sample-return-missions">Phase IV: Sample-return missions <a href="#phase-iv-sample-return-missions" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The last mission, Chandryaan-6, has been suggested for the time frame of 2030-35.

<p>Following the failure of the Fobos-Grunt mission to Mars, Russia withdrew from the Chandrayaan-2 mission as the technical aspects connected with the Fobos-Grunt mission were also used in the lunar projects, which needed to be reviewed. India then decided to develop the lunar mission independently, repurposing unused orbiter hardware for the Mars Orbiter Mission.</p>
<p>Chandrayaan-2 was launched on 22 July 2019 aboard an LVM3 rocket. The spacecraft was successfully put into lunar orbit on August 20, 2019, but the lander was lost while attempting to land on 6 September 2019. The orbiter remains operational, collecting scientific data, and is expected to function for 7.5 years.</p>
<p>Chandrayaan-3, launched on 14 July 2023, was a re-attempt to demonstrate the landing capabilities needed for the Lunar Polar Exploration Mission proposed in partnership with Japan for 2025. The primary goals of the Chandrayaan-3 mission were to showcase a successful and controlled touchdown on the lunar surface, demonstrate the mobility of a rover on the Moon&rsquo;s terrain, and carry out scientific experiments directly on the lunar surface.</p>

<h1 id="chandrayaan-programme-overview-1">Chandrayaan Programme Overview <a href="#chandrayaan-programme-overview-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The Chandrayaan Programme, also known as the Indian Lunar Exploration Programme, is an ongoing series of outer space missions by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The programme, which translates to &lsquo;Moon craft&rsquo; in Sanskrit, incorporates lunar orbiter, impactor, soft lander, and rover spacecraft. The programme structure includes multiple missions, with the first orbiter and impactor probe sent to the Moon in September 2019, using ISRO&rsquo;s PSLV rocket. The second spacecraft, comprising an orbiter, soft lander, and rover, was launched on 22 July 2019, using a LVM-3 rocket. There are plans for follow-up missions, including the Chandrayaan-3 mission, which was launched on 14 July 2023.</p>
<h1 id="mission-phases">Mission Phases <a href="#mission-phases" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The Chandrayaan programme is divided into four main phases. The first phase, Orbiter and Impactor, was initiated with the launch of Chandrayaan-1 on 22 October 2008. The mission was a significant achievement for ISRO as it discovered water on the Moon. The second phase, Soft landers and rovers, saw the launch of Chandrayaan-2 on 22 July 2019. Although the lander was lost during an attempted landing, the orbiter remains operational and continues to collect scientific data. The third phase, On-site sampling, will involve the Lunar Polar Exploration Mission or Chandrayaan-4, set to launch in 2025. The final phase, Sample-return missions, is planned for the timeframe of 2030-35 with the Chandrayaan-6 mission.</p>

The term &lsquo;Chandrayaan&rsquo; is derived from Sanskrit, with &lsquo;Chandra&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;Moon&rsquo; and &lsquo;yaan&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;craft&rsquo;. The programme encompasses various types of spacecraft, including lunar orbiters, impactors, soft landers, and rovers.</p>
<h2 id="programme-structure-3">Programme Structure <a href="#programme-structure-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Chandrayaan programme is a multi-mission initiative. As of September 2019, one orbiter with an impactor probe has been sent to the Moon, using ISRO&rsquo;s PSLV rocket, often referred to as their &lsquo;workhorse&rsquo;. The second spacecraft, consisting of an orbiter, soft lander, and rover, was launched on 22 July 2019, using an LVM-3 rocket.</p>
<p>In a podcast from AT, VSSC director S. Somanath revealed that there would be a Chandrayaan-3 and more follow-up missions in the Chandrayaan Programme. The Chandrayaan-3 mission was launched on 14 July 2023 using an LVM-3 and is expected to reach the Moon&rsquo;s surface in August.</p>
<h2 id="phase-i-orbiter-and-impactor-3">Phase I: Orbiter and Impactor <a href="#phase-i-orbiter-and-impactor-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="chandrayaan-1">Chandrayaan-1 <a href="#chandrayaan-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The Chandrayaan project was first announced by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in his Independence Day speech on 15 August 2003. The idea of an Indian scientific mission to the Moon was first proposed in 1999 during a meeting of the Indian Academy of Sciences. The Astronautical Society of India further developed the idea in 2000.</p>
<p>Following this, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) established the National Lunar Mission Task Force, which concluded that ISRO had the technical expertise to carry out an Indian mission to the Moon. In April 2003, over 100 eminent Indian scientists in various fields discussed and approved the Task Force recommendation to launch an Indian probe to the Moon. Six months later, in November, the Indian government gave the nod for the mission.</p>
<p>The first phase of the programme included the launch of the first lunar orbiters. Chandrayaan-1, launched on 22 October 2008 aboard a PSLV-XL rocket, was a significant success for ISRO. The Moon Impact Probe, a payload on board the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, discovered water on the Moon. In addition to discovering water, the Chandrayaan-1 mission performed several other tasks such as mapping and atmospheric profiling of the Moon.</p>

Although ISRO finalized the payload for Chandrayaan-2 per schedule, the mission was postponed in January 2013 and rescheduled to 2016 because Russia was unable to develop the lander on time.</p>
<p>Roscosmos later withdrew in the wake of the failure of the Fobos-Grunt mission to Mars, since the technical aspects connected with the Fobos-Grunt mission were also used in the lunar projects, which needed to be reviewed. When Russia cited its inability to provide the lander even by 2015, India decided to develop the lunar mission independently, and unused orbiter hardware was repurposed to be used for the Mars Orbiter Mission.</p>

<h3 id="chandrayaan-3">Chandrayaan-3 <a href="#chandrayaan-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In November 2019, ISRO officials stated that a new lunar lander mission was being studied for launch in November 2020. This new proposal is called Chandrayaan-3, and it would be a re-attempt to demonstrate the landing capabilities needed for the Lunar Polar Exploration Mission proposed in partnership with Japan for 2025.</p>
<p>This spacecraft configuration would not include launching an orbiter and would have a lander, rover, and a propulsion module with a mission costing ‚Çπ 250 crore with additional launch costs of ‚Çπ 365 crore for LVM3. This third mission would land in the same area as the second one. Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023 at 9:05:17 UTC. The primary goals of the Chandrayaan-3 mission encompass three key aspects. Firstly, it aims to showcase a successful and controlled touchdown on the lunar surface.

<p>Cybernetics is like being the captain of a ship. The captain watches how the ship moves and makes changes to keep it on course, even when the wind or waves try to push it off. This is called feedback. Cybernetics is the study of these feedback systems, not just in ships, but in everything from machines to animals to groups of people. It helps us understand how things work and how to make them work better. The word &ldquo;cybernetics&rdquo; comes from an ancient Greek word meaning &lsquo;steersman&rsquo;, which is like a ship&rsquo;s captain.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-cybernetics">Understanding Cybernetics <a href="#understanding-cybernetics" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Cybernetics is a big word, but it&rsquo;s not as scary as it sounds! It&rsquo;s all about how things work together, like a captain steering a ship. The captain watches where the ship is going and makes changes to the steering to keep the ship on course. This is a type of feedback, where the captain uses the information about where the ship is to decide what to do next. Cybernetics can be used to understand lots of different things, like how animals behave, how machines work, or how people learn and manage things. It can even help people from different areas work together because it gives them a common language to talk about how things work.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-cybernetics-mean">What Does &ldquo;Cybernetics&rdquo; Mean? <a href="#what-does-cybernetics-mean" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The word &ldquo;cybernetics&rdquo; comes from an old Greek word, Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÇ (kubernƒìtikƒìs), which means &ldquo;good at steering&rdquo;. In the old days, this word was used to talk about how people govern or lead others. The word was first used in the way we use it now by a group of researchers in 1947, including a man named Norbert Wiener. They decided to use this word to talk about their study of how control and communication work in both animals and machines. So, when you hear &ldquo;cybernetics&rdquo;, you can think of it as the study of how things steer themselves.</p>
<h1 id="feedback-a-key-idea-in-cybernetics">Feedback: A Key Idea in Cybernetics <a href="#feedback-a-key-idea-in-cybernetics" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>One of the most important ideas in cybernetics is feedback. Feedback is when the outcome of an action is used to decide what to do next. It&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re playing a game and you learn from what happened last time to decide what move to make next. Feedback can be found in many places. For example, a thermostat in your house uses feedback to keep the temperature just right. When the temperature gets too hot or too cold, the thermostat tells the heater or air conditioner to turn on or off. This is a type of feedback because the thermostat uses the information about the temperature (the outcome of the heater or air conditioner&rsquo;s actions) to decide what to do next.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-cybernetics-1">Understanding Cybernetics <a href="#understanding-cybernetics-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Hello, kids! Today, we&rsquo;re going to learn about a fascinating subject called &lsquo;Cybernetics&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a big word, but don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll break it down and make it simple and fun to understand. Let&rsquo;s dive in!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-cybernetics">What is Cybernetics? <a href="#what-is-cybernetics" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Cybernetics is like a big toolbox full of different tools that help us understand how things work and how they&rsquo;re connected. It&rsquo;s all about how things affect each other in a loop, like when you shout into a canyon and hear your echo. This is called a &lsquo;feedback loop&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re steering a ship. You turn the wheel to the right, and the ship starts moving right. But then, a strong wind pushes the ship to the left. You notice this and turn the wheel more to the right to keep the ship on course. This is an example of a feedback loop in cybernetics.</p>
<p>Cybernetics isn&rsquo;t just about ships or machines. It&rsquo;s also about how animals, people, and nature work. It&rsquo;s about learning, designing, managing, and much more. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s used in many different areas, from biology to technology, and even in social systems like families or schools.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-cybernetics-mean-1">What Does &lsquo;Cybernetics&rsquo; Mean? <a href="#what-does-cybernetics-mean-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The word &lsquo;cybernetics&rsquo; comes from an Ancient Greek word, Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÇ (kubernƒìtikƒìs), which means &lsquo;good at steering&rsquo;. This word was used by Plato, an ancient Greek philosopher, to describe how people can be guided or governed. Later, in 1834, a French physicist named Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re used the word &lsquo;cybern√©tique&rsquo; to describe the science of government.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;cybernetics&rsquo; as we use it today was introduced by a man named Norbert Wiener and his research group in 1947. They chose this word because it reminded them of the idea of a governor or a steersman, guiding a ship or a system.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-feedback-work-in-cybernetics">How Does Feedback Work in Cybernetics? <a href="#how-does-feedback-work-in-cybernetics" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>In cybernetics, feedback is like a conversation between different parts of a system. Let&rsquo;s go back to our ship example. The helmsperson (that&rsquo;s the person steering the ship) turns the wheel, and the ship moves. But then the wind or the waves push the ship off course. The helmsperson sees this and adjusts the steering. This is a feedback loop.</p>
<p>Feedback loops are everywhere! In a thermostat, the device measures the room&rsquo;s temperature and turns the heater on or off to keep the room warm. In our bodies, our nervous system helps us move our hands and feet. In a conversation, we listen to what someone else says and then respond based on what we heard.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-of-cybernetics">The History of Cybernetics <a href="#the-history-of-cybernetics" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="the-first-wave">The First Wave <a href="#the-first-wave" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Cybernetics started with people studying how feedback works in living creatures and machines. They had meetings called the Macy Conferences from 1946 to 1953, where they shared their ideas. Norbert Wiener, who we mentioned earlier, wrote a book called &lsquo;Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine&rsquo; that helped spread these ideas.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, cybernetics was mostly used in technical fields like engineering. But by the 1960s and 1970s, people started using cybernetics in many other areas. Some people focused on artificial intelligence, which is about making machines that can think like humans. Others studied how computers work, which led to the field of computer science.</p>
<h3 id="the-second-wave">The Second Wave <a href="#the-second-wave" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In the 1960s, people started using cybernetics to study social systems, like families or societies. They also used it to understand how we learn and how we know things. This was called &lsquo;second-order cybernetics&rsquo; or the &lsquo;cybernetics of cybernetics&rsquo;.</p>
<p>During this time, cybernetics also started influencing art, design, and architecture. People used cybernetic ideas to create interactive artwork and buildings.</p>
<h3 id="the-third-wave">The Third Wave <a href="#the-third-wave" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>From the 1990s onwards, there has been a renewed interest in cybernetics. People are using cybernetic ideas to build smarter machines and to understand how technology affects society. They&rsquo;re also looking back at the history of cybernetics and finding new ways to use its ideas.</p>
<h2 id="key-ideas-in-cybernetics">Key Ideas in Cybernetics <a href="#key-ideas-in-cybernetics" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>There are many different ideas in cybernetics. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Autopoiesis&rsquo;: This is a fancy word that means &lsquo;self-making&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s about how systems can create and maintain themselves.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Feedback&rsquo;: This is about how actions can affect future actions in a loop.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Double bind theory&rsquo;: This is about how confusing messages can create problems in relationships.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Perceptual control theory&rsquo;: This is about how we control our actions based on what we perceive or see.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cybernetics-in-different-fields">Cybernetics in Different Fields <a href="#cybernetics-in-different-fields" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Cybernetics is used in many different fields. It started with engineering and biology, but now it&rsquo;s used in social sciences like anthropology and sociology, in business management, in design, and in education.</p>
<p>For example, in Chile, they once used cybernetic ideas to manage their economy. In design, cybernetics is used to create interactive buildings and computer interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="cybernetics-today">Cybernetics Today <a href="#cybernetics-today" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Today, there are many academic journals and societies that focus on cybernetics. They share new research and ideas about cybernetics. Some of these include the &lsquo;American Society for Cybernetics&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Cybernetics Society&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it, kids! That&rsquo;s a basic introduction to cybernetics. It&rsquo;s a big field with lots of interesting ideas, and it&rsquo;s used in many different areas. Remember, the key idea in cybernetics is feedback - how actions affect future actions in a loop. And remember, cybernetics is not just about machines or technology, it&rsquo;s also about animals, people, and nature.</p>

<p>Cybernetics is a broad field that studies circular causal processes such as feedback in various systems, including ecological, technological, biological, cognitive, and social. It was named by Norbert Wiener after the process of steering a ship, where the helmsman adjusts their steering based on the observed effects, allowing for a steady course despite disturbances. Cybernetics has been defined in various ways, reflecting its diverse conceptual base, but it is generally concerned with control and communication in both animals and machines. The term &ldquo;cybernetics&rdquo; comes from the Ancient Greek word for &ldquo;steering&rdquo; and was coined in 1947 by a research group involving Wiener.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-cybernetics-2">Understanding Cybernetics <a href="#understanding-cybernetics-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Cybernetics is a broad field that focuses on circular causal processes like feedback. An example of this is steering a ship, where the helmsman adjusts their steering based on the observed effect, allowing the ship to maintain a steady course despite disturbances such as wind or tides. Cybernetics can be applied to various systems including ecological, technological, biological, cognitive, and social systems. It also intersects with other fields due to its transdisciplinary nature, making it influential and open to diverse interpretations.</p>
<h1 id="defining-cybernetics">Defining Cybernetics <a href="#defining-cybernetics" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>There are many definitions of cybernetics, reflecting its rich conceptual base. Norbert Wiener, who named the field, defined it as the study of control and communication in animals and machines. The Macy cybernetics conferences defined it as the study of circular causal and feedback mechanisms in biological and social systems. Other definitions range from &ldquo;the art of governing or the science of government&rdquo; to &ldquo;the science and art of understanding&rdquo;. These varying definitions highlight the breadth and depth of the field.</p>
<h1 id="the-origin-of-the-term-cybernetics">The Origin of the Term Cybernetics <a href="#the-origin-of-the-term-cybernetics" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The term cybernetics comes from the Ancient Greek term Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÇ (kubernƒìtikƒìs, &lsquo;(good at) steering&rsquo;) which appeared in Plato&rsquo;s Republic and Alcibiades. The French word cybern√©tique was also used in 1834 by physicist Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re to denote the sciences of government. According to Norbert Wiener, the term cybernetics was coined by a research group in the summer of 1947 and has been in print since 1948. The term was chosen to recognize the early and well-developed forms of feedback mechanisms such as the steering engines of a ship.</p>

<h1 id="cybernetics-a-comprehensive-study">Cybernetics: A Comprehensive Study <a href="#cybernetics-a-comprehensive-study" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Cybernetics is a broad and fascinating field that deals with circular causal processes, such as feedback. This field was named by Norbert Wiener, who drew inspiration from the feedback process involved in steering a ship. The helmsman adjusts their steering based on the observed effects, thus maintaining a steady course despite disturbances like cross-winds or tides. Cybernetics is not limited to a single discipline; it encompasses various systems, including ecological, technological, biological, cognitive, and social systems. It also plays a crucial role in practical activities like designing, learning, managing, and more. Its transdisciplinary nature has led to its intersection with numerous other fields, resulting in a wide influence and diverse interpretations.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions <a href="#definitions" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The term &lsquo;Cybernetics&rsquo; has been defined in many ways, reflecting the richness of its conceptual base. Norbert Wiener, one of the pioneers in the field, defined cybernetics as the study of &ldquo;control and communication in the animal and the machine.&rdquo; Another definition from the Macy cybernetics conferences describes it as the study of &ldquo;circular causal and feedback mechanisms in biological and social systems.&rdquo; Margaret Mead, a renowned anthropologist, emphasized the role of cybernetics as a form of cross-disciplinary thought, enabling easy communication among members of various disciplines.</p>
<p>Several other definitions include &ldquo;the art of governing or the science of government&rdquo; (Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re), &ldquo;the art of steersmanship&rdquo; (Ross Ashby), &ldquo;the study of systems of any nature which are capable of receiving, storing, and processing information so as to use it for control&rdquo; (Andrey Kolmogorov), and &ldquo;the science and art of understanding&rdquo; (Humberto Maturana), among others.</p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology <a href="#etymology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The term &lsquo;Cybernetics&rsquo; comes from the Ancient Greek term Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÇ (kubernƒìtikƒìs), which means &lsquo;(good at) steering.&rsquo; This term appears in Plato&rsquo;s Republic and Alcibiades, where the metaphor of a steersman signifies the governance of people. The French word &lsquo;cybern√©tique&rsquo; was used in 1834 by physicist Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re to denote the sciences of government.</p>
<p>According to Norbert Wiener, the term &lsquo;Cybernetics&rsquo; was coined by a research group that included himself and Arturo Rosenblueth in the summer of 1947. They chose this term to recognize James Clerk Maxwell&rsquo;s 1868 publication on feedback mechanisms involving governors. Wiener explains that the term was chosen as the steering engines of a ship are &ldquo;one of the earliest and best-developed forms of feedback mechanisms&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="feedback">Feedback <a href="#feedback" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Feedback is a crucial concept in cybernetics. It is a process where the outcomes of actions are used as inputs for further action, creating a circular causal relationship. This process is evident in steering a ship, where the helmsperson continually adjusts their steering based on its observed effects, thus maintaining a steady course. Other examples of feedback include technological devices like thermostats, biological processes like the coordination of movement through the nervous system, and social interaction processes like conversation.</p>
<h2 id="history-3">History <a href="#history-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="first-wave">First Wave <a href="#first-wave" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The initial focus of cybernetics was on the similarities between regulatory feedback processes in biological and technological systems. Two foundational articles published in 1943 laid the groundwork for the field. These articles were &ldquo;Behavior, Purpose and Teleology&rdquo; by Arturo Rosenblueth, Norbert Wiener, and Julian Bigelow, and &ldquo;A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity&rdquo; by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts.</p>
<p>The foundations of cybernetics were further developed through a series of transdisciplinary conferences funded by the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, between 1946 and 1953. Participants in these conferences included Ross Ashby, Gregory Bateson, Heinz von Foerster, Margaret Mead, John von Neumann, and Norbert Wiener.</p>
<p>During the 1950s, cybernetics developed as a primarily technical discipline. However, by the 1960s and 1970s, the transdisciplinary nature of cybernetics led to its fragmentation, with technical focuses separating into distinct fields. Artificial intelligence (AI) was founded as a distinct discipline at the Dartmouth workshop in 1956, differentiating itself from the broader cybernetics field.</p>
<h3 id="second-wave">Second Wave <a href="#second-wave" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The second wave of cybernetics, which gained prominence from the 1960s onwards, shifted its focus from technology to social, ecological, and philosophical concerns. This wave was grounded in biology and built on earlier work on self-organising systems. It focused on management cybernetics, work in family therapy, social systems, epistemology and pedagogy, and the development of radical constructivism. The second wave of cybernetics also saw the development of exchanges with the creative arts, design, and architecture.</p>
<h3 id="third-wave">Third Wave <a href="#third-wave" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>From the 1990s onwards, there has been a renewed interest in cybernetics. Early cybernetic work on artificial neural networks has been revisited as a paradigm in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The entanglements of society with emerging technologies have led to exchanges with feminist technoscience and posthumanism.</p>
<h2 id="key-concepts-and-theories">Key Concepts and Theories <a href="#key-concepts-and-theories" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Several key concepts and theories are central to the understanding of cybernetics. These include Autopoiesis, Black box, Circularity (feedback, feedforward, recursion, reflexivity), Conversation theory, Double bind theory, Experimental epistemology, Good regulator theorem, Method of levels, Perceptual control theory, Radical constructivism, Second-order cybernetics, Requisite Variety, Self-organisation, Social systems theory, and Viable system model.</p>
<h2 id="related-fields-and-applications">Related Fields and Applications <a href="#related-fields-and-applications" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Cybernetics has a wide range of applications and relations with other fields due to its central concept of circular causality. Initial applications of cybernetics focused on engineering and biology, such as medical cybernetics and robotics, and topics such as neural networks, heterarchy. In the social and behavioral sciences, cybernetics has influenced work in anthropology, sociology, economics, family therapy, cognitive science, and psychology.</p>
<h2 id="journals-and-societies">Journals and Societies <a href="#journals-and-societies" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Several academic journals focus on cybernetics, such as Constructivist Foundations, Cybernetics and Human Knowing, and Cybernetics and Systems. Academic societies primarily concerned with cybernetics or aspects of it include the American Society for Cybernetics, the Cybernetics Society, and the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society.</p>

<p>Cybernetics is a broad field that studies circular causal processes such as feedback. It was named by Norbert Wiener, who used the example of steering a ship to explain the concept of feedback. Cybernetics is not limited to any specific embodiment and is used in diverse fields such as ecology, technology, biology, cognition, and social systems. The term cybernetics was coined in 1947 and has been in print since at least 1948. The concept of feedback, where the outcomes of actions are used as inputs for further action, is central to cybernetics. The field has evolved in three waves, focusing initially on biological and technological systems, then on social, ecological, and philosophical concerns, and most recently on artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>

<h1 id="cybernetics-a-transdisciplinary-approach">Cybernetics: A Transdisciplinary Approach <a href="#cybernetics-a-transdisciplinary-approach" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Cybernetics, a term coined by Norbert Wiener, is a far-reaching field focused on circular causal processes such as feedback. It draws from an example of steering a ship, where the helmsman adjusts their steering in response to its observed effects, thereby maintaining a steady course despite disturbances like cross-winds or tides. Cybernetics encompasses a wide range of systems, including ecological, technological, biological, cognitive, and social, and is involved in practical activities such as designing and managing. The transdisciplinary nature of cybernetics has allowed it to intersect with numerous other fields, leading to its broad influence and diverse interpretations.</p>
<h1 id="definitions-and-etymology">Definitions and Etymology <a href="#definitions-and-etymology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Cybernetics has been defined in various ways, reflecting the richness of its conceptual base. Early definitions by Wiener and the Macy cybernetics conferences described it as a study of control and communication in the animal and the machine, and the study of circular causal and feedback mechanisms in biological and social systems, respectively. Other definitions range from &ldquo;the art of governing&rdquo; to &ldquo;the science of understanding&rdquo;. The term cybernetics, derived from the Ancient Greek term Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÇ (kubernƒìtikƒìs, &lsquo;(good at) steering&rsquo;), was used to represent the governance of people. Wiener and his research group coined the term in 1947, and it has been in print since at least 1948.</p>
<h1 id="feedback-and-history">Feedback and History <a href="#feedback-and-history" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Feedback is a critical process in cybernetics, where observed outcomes of actions are used as inputs for further action, forming a circular causal relationship. Examples include steering a ship, regulating room temperature with a thermostat, and social interaction processes like conversation. The history of cybernetics can be divided into three waves. The first wave focused on regulatory feedback processes in biological and technological systems. The second wave, from the 1960s onwards, shifted focus towards social, ecological, and philosophical concerns. From the 1990s onwards, the third wave saw a renewed interest in cybernetics, with emerging topics including how cybernetics&rsquo; engagements with social, human, and ecological contexts might combine with its earlier technological focus.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-cybernetics-an-in-depth-analysis">Understanding Cybernetics: An In-Depth Analysis <a href="#understanding-cybernetics-an-in-depth-analysis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Cybernetics is a field that encompasses a broad range of disciplines, focusing on the study of systems and their inherent feedback loops. Named by Norbert Wiener, the term &lsquo;cybernetics&rsquo; is derived from the Greek word for steersman, encapsulating the concept of maintaining a steady course amidst disturbances. This field finds application in numerous domains, from ecological and technological systems to cognitive and social systems. The transdisciplinary nature of cybernetics has led to its intersection with numerous other fields, making its influence wide-reaching and its interpretations diverse.</p>
<h2 id="defining-cybernetics-1">Defining Cybernetics <a href="#defining-cybernetics-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Cybernetics has been defined in a multitude of ways, reflecting the richness of its conceptual base.

<p>Margaret Mead emphasized the role of cybernetics as a form of cross-disciplinary thought, enabling members from various fields to communicate effectively. Other definitions of cybernetics range from &ldquo;the art of governing or the science of government&rdquo; (Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re) to &ldquo;the science and art of understanding&rdquo; (Humberto Maturana).</p>
<h2 id="origin-of-the-term-cybernetics">Origin of the Term &lsquo;Cybernetics&rsquo; <a href="#origin-of-the-term-cybernetics" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The term &lsquo;cybernetics&rsquo; has its roots in ancient Greek, where the word Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÇ (kubernƒìtikƒìs) was used to signify the governance of people. Norbert Wiener, along with a research group including Arturo Rosenblueth, coined the term &lsquo;cybernetics&rsquo; in the summer of 1947. Wiener used the term to denote the entire field of control and communication theory, whether in the machine or the animal.</p>
<p>The choice of the term was also influenced by James Clerk Maxwell&rsquo;s 1868 publication on feedback mechanisms involving governors, as the term governor is derived from the Greek word Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ (kubern·∏ótƒìs) via a Latin corruption gubernator. The feedback mechanisms in the steering engines of a ship, being one of the earliest forms of feedback mechanisms, further motivated the choice of the term.</p>

<p>Epistemology is like a big word for a detective kit. It helps us understand what knowledge is, where it comes from, and how we know what we know. It&rsquo;s like asking, &ldquo;How do I know that 2+2=4?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How can I be sure that my memory of yesterday&rsquo;s lunch is accurate?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a part of philosophy, which is like a big tree with many branches, and it&rsquo;s been studied by thinkers from all over the world for thousands of years. It&rsquo;s all about exploring and understanding the mystery of knowledge.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-epistemology">Understanding Epistemology <a href="#understanding-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Epistemology is a big word that sounds complicated, but it&rsquo;s actually just about understanding how we know things. It&rsquo;s like being a detective of knowledge! Epistemologists, or people who study epistemology, ask questions like &ldquo;What do people know?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How do people know that they know?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;What makes our beliefs justified?&rdquo; They also look at where our knowledge comes from, whether it&rsquo;s from what we see, what we remember, or what others tell us. They even explore if all our beliefs need to come from a solid foundation of justified beliefs, or if they just need to fit together in a way that makes sense.</p>
<h1 id="the-history-of-epistemology">The History of Epistemology <a href="#the-history-of-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The word &ldquo;epistemology&rdquo; comes from the ancient Greek word &ldquo;epistƒìmƒì,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; and the English suffix &ldquo;-ology,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;the science or discipline of.&rdquo; So, epistemology is like the science of knowledge! This idea has been around for a long time. Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle thought a lot about what people know and how they know it. Later, during the Middle Ages, philosophers like Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham also asked big questions about knowledge. Even today, philosophers continue to explore these ideas, trying to understand how our past ideas about knowledge connect to our current ones.</p>
<h1 id="key-concepts-in-epistemology">Key Concepts in Epistemology <a href="#key-concepts-in-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>In epistemology, there are a few key ideas that come up a lot. One of these is &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; which is what we&rsquo;re familiar with or understand. This could be facts, like knowing that 2 + 2 = 4, skills, like knowing how to ride a bike, or even knowing a person or a place. Another important idea is &ldquo;belief,&rdquo; which is what we think is true. For example, if you think that snow is white, that&rsquo;s a belief you have. Lastly, there&rsquo;s &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; which is when something matches up with reality. For example, the statement &ldquo;the sky is blue&rdquo; is true if the sky is actually blue. Epistemologists also talk about &ldquo;justification,&rdquo; which is having a good reason for believing something. So, if you believe that it&rsquo;s going to rain because you see dark clouds in the sky, your belief is justified because dark clouds are a good reason to think it&rsquo;s going to rain.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-epistemology-a-guide-for-kids">Understanding Epistemology: A Guide for Kids <a href="#understanding-epistemology-a-guide-for-kids" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><h2 id="what-is-epistemology">What is Epistemology? <a href="#what-is-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Have you ever asked yourself, &ldquo;How do I know what I know?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What does it mean to know something?&rdquo; These are big questions, and they&rsquo;re part of a subject called Epistemology. It&rsquo;s a big word, but don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll break it down together!</p>
<p>Epistemology comes from two Greek words: &rsquo;episteme&rsquo; which means &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;, and &rsquo;logos&rsquo; which means &lsquo;study&rsquo;. So, epistemology is the study of knowledge. It&rsquo;s a part of philosophy, which is like a big tree with many branches, like ethics (how we should behave), logic (how we should think), and metaphysics (what is real).</p>
<p>Epistemologists, the people who study epistemology, try to understand what knowledge is, where it comes from, and what it means to say we know something. They also think about how we justify our beliefs, and whether it&rsquo;s possible to know things for sure.</p>
<h2 id="where-does-epistemology-come-from">Where Does Epistemology Come From? <a href="#where-does-epistemology-come-from" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The word &rsquo;epistemology&rsquo; was first used in 1847, but the ideas it deals with are much older. Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle were already thinking about these questions. They wondered about the difference between what we know and what exists, and the conditions needed for something to be considered knowledge.</p>
<p>Later, during a time called the Hellenistic period, other philosophers focused more on epistemological questions. Some of them, like the Sceptics, even questioned whether knowledge was possible at all!</p>
<p>During the Middle Ages, philosophers like Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham also thought about these questions. And in the Islamic Golden Age, a philosopher named Al-Ghazali wrote many books about knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>In more recent times, philosophers have been divided into two groups: the empiricists, who think knowledge comes from experience, and the rationalists, who think some knowledge comes from reasoning alone. This debate is still going on today!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-key-concepts-in-epistemology">What Are Some Key Concepts in Epistemology? <a href="#what-are-some-key-concepts-in-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="knowledge">Knowledge <a href="#knowledge" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In epistemology, knowledge is often thought of as being familiar with something, understanding it, or being aware of it. This could be facts (like knowing that the earth orbits the sun), skills (like knowing how to ride a bike), or objects (like knowing your best friend).</p>
<p>Epistemologists usually focus on &lsquo;propositional knowledge&rsquo;, or knowing that something is the case. For example, knowing that &lsquo;2 + 2 = 4&rsquo; is propositional knowledge. But they also think about &lsquo;procedural knowledge&rsquo; (knowing how to do something) and &lsquo;acquaintance knowledge&rsquo; (knowing a person, place, or thing directly).</p>
<h3 id="a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge">A Priori and A Posteriori Knowledge <a href="#a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Epistemologists often talk about two types of knowledge: &lsquo;a priori&rsquo; and &lsquo;a posteriori&rsquo;. A priori knowledge is knowledge we can have without needing to experience anything. For example, you don&rsquo;t need to count two apples and two more apples to know that 2 + 2 = 4. On the other hand, a posteriori knowledge is knowledge we get from experience. For example, you know that ice is cold because you&rsquo;ve felt it before.</p>
<h3 id="belief">Belief <a href="#belief" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Belief is another important concept in epistemology. A belief is something you hold to be true. For example, if you believe that snow is white, you accept the statement &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo; as true. Beliefs can be about anything, and they play a big role in how we understand and interact with the world.</p>
<h3 id="truth">Truth <a href="#truth" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Truth is when something matches up with reality. For example, if I say &ldquo;the sky is blue&rdquo;, and the sky is indeed blue, then what I said is true. Most philosophers agree that truth is needed for knowledge. After all, if what you believe doesn&rsquo;t match up with reality, can you really say you know it?</p>
<h3 id="justification">Justification <a href="#justification" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Justification is having a good reason to believe something. If you&rsquo;re justified in believing something, it means you have good reasons for your belief. These reasons could come from your senses, from reasoning, or from someone else&rsquo;s testimony. But remember, just because you&rsquo;re justified in believing something doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s true!</p>
<h2 id="internalism-and-externalism">Internalism and Externalism <a href="#internalism-and-externalism" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Finally, let&rsquo;s talk about two different ways of thinking about justification: internalism and externalism. Internalists think that justification comes from things inside your own mind, like your thoughts and feelings. Externalists, on the other hand, think that justification can come from things outside your mind, like the world around you.</p>
<p>These are just some of the big ideas in epistemology. There&rsquo;s a lot more to explore, and lots of questions that still need answers. So, the next time you ask yourself &ldquo;how do I know what I know?&rdquo;, remember: you&rsquo;re thinking like an epistemologist!</p>

<p>Epistemology, a branch of philosophy, is the study of knowledge and belief. It explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge, as well as the conditions required for a belief to be considered knowledge. Epistemologists examine potential sources of knowledge like perception, reason, memory, and testimony. They also explore the structure of knowledge and philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility of knowledge. The term &ldquo;epistemology&rdquo; comes from the Greek word &ldquo;epistƒìmƒì,&rdquo; meaning knowledge, and the English suffix &ldquo;-ology,&rdquo; meaning the science or discipline of something. The field has been studied by philosophers throughout history, including ancient Greeks, medieval scholars, and modern thinkers.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-epistemology-1">Understanding Epistemology <a href="#understanding-epistemology-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge. It&rsquo;s like the science of knowing, helping us understand what it means to know something, how we justify our beliefs, and how we can be sure that we truly know something. For example, you might think you know that dogs are mammals because you&rsquo;ve seen dogs and they look like other mammals you know. But an epistemologist would ask, &ldquo;How do you know that what you&rsquo;ve seen is truly representative of all dogs? What makes your belief justified?&rdquo; Epistemologists often debate about what constitutes knowledge, the sources of knowledge, the structure of knowledge, and philosophical skepticism, which questions the very possibility of knowledge.</p>
<h1 id="the-origins-of-epistemology">The Origins of Epistemology <a href="#the-origins-of-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The term &ldquo;epistemology&rdquo; comes from the ancient Greek word &ldquo;epistƒìmƒì,&rdquo; which means knowledge, and the English suffix &ldquo;-ology,&rdquo; which means the science or discipline of something. It was first used in English by the Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier in the mid-19th century. The concept of epistemology, however, can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle. For example, Plato distinguished between what people know and what exists, suggesting that just because we believe something to be true doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it is. This idea was further explored by philosophers during the Hellenistic period, the Medieval period, and the Islamic Golden Age, among others. The debate between empiricists, who believe knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience, and rationalists, who think a significant portion of our knowledge is derived from reason, also played a significant role in the development of epistemology.</p>
<h1 id="key-concepts-in-epistemology-1">Key Concepts in Epistemology <a href="#key-concepts-in-epistemology-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>In epistemology, knowledge is often categorized into propositional knowledge (knowing facts), procedural knowledge (knowing how to do things), and acquaintance knowledge (knowing people, places, or things). For example, knowing that 2+2=4 is propositional knowledge, knowing how to add numbers is procedural knowledge, and knowing your best friend is acquaintance knowledge. Epistemologists also distinguish between a priori knowledge, which is known independently of experience, and a posteriori knowledge, which is known through experience.</p>
<p>Belief, truth, and justification are also central concepts in epistemology. A belief is what a person holds to be true, like believing that snow is white. Truth is being in accordance with facts or reality, like the statement &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo; being true if snow is indeed white. Justification is the reason for holding a belief, like seeing white snow as a justification for believing that snow is white. However, a belief being justified does not guarantee that it is true, as one could have good reasons for holding a false belief.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-epistemology-2">Understanding Epistemology <a href="#understanding-epistemology-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><h2 id="introduction-to-epistemology">Introduction to Epistemology <a href="#introduction-to-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Epistemology, a term derived from the Ancient Greek words &rsquo;epist·∏ómƒì&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;, and &lsquo;-logy&rsquo; meaning &rsquo;the study of&rsquo;, is a branch of philosophy that deals with the theory of knowledge. It is a significant subfield of philosophy, along with other major subfields such as ethics, logic, and metaphysics.</p>
<p>Epistemologists, or those who study epistemology, delve into the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge. They are interested in understanding what constitutes justified beliefs, the rationality of belief, and various related issues. They aim to answer questions such as &ldquo;What do people know?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What does it mean to say that people know something?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What makes justified beliefs justified?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;How do people know that they know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Epistemology is often divided into four core areas of debate:</p>
<ol>
<li>The philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge, such as truth and justification.</li>
<li>Potential sources of knowledge and justified belief, such as perception, reason, memory, and testimony.</li>
<li>The structure of a body of knowledge or justified belief, including whether all justified beliefs must be derived from justified foundational beliefs or whether justification requires only a coherent set of beliefs.</li>
<li>Philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility of knowledge, and related problems, such as whether skepticism poses a threat to our ordinary knowledge claims and whether it is possible to refute skeptical arguments.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-origin-of-the-word-epistemology">The Origin of the Word &lsquo;Epistemology&rsquo; <a href="#the-origin-of-the-word-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The term &rsquo;epistemology&rsquo; comes from the ancient Greek word &rsquo;epistƒìmƒì&rsquo;, which means &ldquo;knowledge, understanding, skill, scientific knowledge&rdquo;, and the English suffix &lsquo;-ology&rsquo;, which means &ldquo;the science or discipline of (what is indicated by the first element)&rdquo;. The word &rsquo;epistemology&rsquo; first appeared in 1847, in a review in New York&rsquo;s Eclectic Magazine. Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier first used the term to present a philosophy in English in 1854. He used it as the title of the first section of his Institutes of Metaphysics, where he defined epistemology as the doctrine or theory of knowing, just as ontology is the science of being.</p>
<h2 id="historical-and-philosophical-context-of-epistemology">Historical and Philosophical Context of Epistemology <a href="#historical-and-philosophical-context-of-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The study of knowledge and its nature has been a topic of interest for philosophers since ancient times. Among the Ancient Greek philosophers, Plato distinguished between inquiry regarding what people know and inquiry regarding what exists. In his dialogue, Meno, the definition of knowledge as justified true belief appears for the first time. Aristotle also explored important epistemological concerns in his works.</p>
<p>During the Hellenistic period, philosophical schools with a greater focus on epistemological questions began to appear, often in the form of philosophical skepticism. For instance, the Hellenistic Sceptics, especially Sextus Empiricus of the Pyrrhonian school, rejected the possibility of knowledge based on Agrippa&rsquo;s trilemma. The Pyrrhonian school held that happiness could be attained through the suspension of judgment regarding all non-evident matters. The other major school of Hellenistic skepticism was Academic skepticism, defended by Carneades and Arcesilaus, which predominated in the Platonic Academy for almost two centuries.</p>
<p>In ancient India, the Aj√±ana school of ancient Indian philosophy promoted skepticism. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or to ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation.</p>
<p>Medieval philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham also engaged with epistemological questions. During the Islamic Golden Age, Al-Ghazali, a prominent and influential philosopher, theologian, jurist, logician and mystic, made significant contributions to Islamic epistemology.</p>
<p>Epistemology came to the fore in philosophy during the early modern period, which saw a dispute between empiricists, who believed that knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience, and rationalists, who believed that a significant portion of our knowledge is derived entirely from our faculty of reason. This dispute was reportedly resolved in the late 18th century by Immanuel Kant, whose transcendental idealism famously made room for the view that &ldquo;though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means follows that all [knowledge] arises out of experience&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="contemporary-historiography-of-epistemology">Contemporary Historiography of Epistemology <a href="#contemporary-historiography-of-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Contemporary scholars use different methods to understand the relationship between past epistemology and contemporary epistemology. One of the contentious questions is whether the problems of epistemology are perennial, and whether trying to reconstruct and evaluate the arguments of philosophers like Plato, Hume, or Kant is meaningful for current debates. Barry Stroud claims that doing epistemology competently requires the historical study of past attempts to find philosophical understanding of the nature and scope of human knowledge. He argues that since inquiry may progress over time, we may not realize how different the questions that contemporary epistemologists ask are from questions asked at various different points in the history of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="central-concepts-in-epistemology">Central Concepts in Epistemology <a href="#central-concepts-in-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="knowledge-1">Knowledge <a href="#knowledge-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Nearly all debates in epistemology are in some way related to knowledge. Most generally, &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, which might include facts (propositional knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge). Philosophers tend to draw an important distinction between three different senses of &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; something: &ldquo;knowing that&rdquo; (knowing the truth of propositions), &ldquo;knowing how&rdquo; (understanding how to perform certain actions), and &ldquo;knowing by acquaintance&rdquo; (directly perceiving an object, being familiar with it, or otherwise coming into contact with it). Epistemology is primarily concerned with the first of these forms of knowledge, propositional knowledge.</p>
<h4 id="a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge-1">A priori and a posteriori knowledge <a href="#a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h4><p>A key distinction in epistemology is between what can be known a priori (independently of experience) and what can be known a posteriori (through experience). A priori knowledge is knowledge that is known independently of experience, or arrived at before experience, usually by reason. A posteriori knowledge is knowledge that is known by experience, or arrived at through experience. Views that emphasize the importance of a priori knowledge are generally classified as rationalist, while views that emphasize the importance of a posteriori knowledge are generally classified as empiricist.</p>
<h3 id="belief-1">Belief <a href="#belief-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Belief is another core concept in epistemology. A belief is an attitude that a person holds regarding anything that they take to be true. For instance, to believe that snow is white is comparable to accepting the truth of the proposition &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;. Beliefs can be occurrent (a person actively thinking &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;), or they can be dispositional (a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;). While there is not universal agreement about the nature of belief, most contemporary philosophers hold the view that a disposition to express belief B qualifies as holding the belief B.</p>
<h3 id="truth-1">Truth <a href="#truth-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Truth is the property or state of being in accordance with facts or reality. On most views, truth is the correspondence of language or thought to a mind-independent world. This is called the correspondence theory of truth. Among philosophers who think that it is possible to analyze the conditions necessary for knowledge, virtually all of them accept that truth is such a condition. There is much less agreement about the extent to which a knower must know why something is true in order to know.</p>
<h3 id="justification-1">Justification <a href="#justification-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>As the term &ldquo;justification&rdquo; is used in epistemology, a belief is justified if one has good reason for holding it. Loosely speaking, justification is the reason that someone holds a rationally admissible belief, on the assumption that it is a good reason for holding it. Sources of justification might include perceptual experience (the evidence of the senses), reason, and authoritative testimony, among others. Importantly however, a belief being justified does not guarantee that the belief is true, since a person could be justified in forming beliefs based on very convincing evidence that was nonetheless deceiving.</p>
<h4 id="internalism-and-externalism-1">Internalism and externalism <a href="#internalism-and-externalism-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h4><p>A central debate about the nature of justification is a debate between epistemological externalists on the one hand and epistemological internalists on the other. While epistemic externalism first arose in attempts to overcome the Gettier problem, it has flourished in the time since as an alternative way of conceiving of epistemic justification. The initial development of epistemic externalism is often attributed to Alvin Goldman.</p>

On most views, truth is the correspondence of language or thought to a mind-independent world. Justification, in the context of epistemology, refers to having a good reason for holding a belief. However, a belief being justified does not guarantee that the belief is true.</p>
<h1 id="a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge-2">A Priori and A Posteriori Knowledge <a href="#a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>One of the important distinctions in epistemology is between what can be known a priori (independently of experience) and what can be known a posteriori (through experience). A priori knowledge is non-empirical and is acquired through anything that is independent from experience. A posteriori knowledge, on the other hand, is empirical and is arrived at through experience. Views that emphasize the importance of a priori knowledge are generally classified as rationalist, while those that emphasize the importance of a posteriori knowledge are generally classified as empiricist.</p>

<h1 id="an-in-depth-examination-of-epistemology">An In-Depth Examination of Epistemology <a href="#an-in-depth-examination-of-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Epistemology, a term derived from the Ancient Greek words ·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒÆŒºŒ∑ (epist·∏ómƒì) meaning &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;, and -logy, is a significant branch of philosophy that deals with the theory of knowledge. This field of study is concerned with the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge, epistemic justification, the rationality of belief, and various related issues. Epistemology is a major subfield of philosophy, along with other significant subfields such as ethics, logic, and metaphysics.</p>
<h2 id="core-areas-of-epistemological-debates">Core Areas of Epistemological Debates <a href="#core-areas-of-epistemological-debates" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Epistemological debates are generally clustered around four core areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Philosophical Analysis of Knowledge:</strong> This area involves the analysis of the nature of knowledge and the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge, such as truth and justification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential Sources of Knowledge:</strong> This area explores potential sources of knowledge and justified belief, such as perception, reason, memory, and testimony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Structure of Knowledge:</strong> This area deals with the structure of a body of knowledge or justified belief, including whether all justified beliefs must be derived from justified foundational beliefs or whether justification requires only a coherent set of beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Philosophical Skepticism:</strong> This area questions the possibility of knowledge, and related problems, such as whether skepticism poses a threat to our ordinary knowledge claims and whether it is possible to refute skeptical arguments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In these debates and others, epistemology aims to answer questions such as &ldquo;What do people know?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What does it mean to say that people know something?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What makes justified beliefs justified?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;How do people know that they know?&rdquo; Specialties in epistemology ask questions such as &ldquo;How can people create formal models about issues related to knowledge?&rdquo; (in formal epistemology), &ldquo;What are the historical conditions of changes in different kinds of knowledge?&rdquo; (in historical epistemology), &ldquo;What are the methods, aims, and subject matter of epistemological inquiry?&rdquo; (in metaepistemology), and &ldquo;How do people know together?&rdquo; (in social epistemology).</p>
<h2 id="etymology-of-epistemology">Etymology of Epistemology <a href="#etymology-of-epistemology" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The term &rsquo;epistemology&rsquo; is derived from the ancient Greek word &rsquo;epistƒìmƒì&rsquo;, which means &ldquo;knowledge, understanding, skill, scientific knowledge&rdquo;, and the English suffix &lsquo;-ology&rsquo;, which denotes &ldquo;the science or discipline of (what is indicated by the first element)&rdquo;. The term first appeared in 1847, in a review in New York&rsquo;s Eclectic Magazine. Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier was the first to use the word to present a philosophy in English in 1854. He used it as the title of the first section of his Institutes of Metaphysics, defining it as the doctrine or theory of knowing, just as ontology is the science of being. It answers the general question, &lsquo;What is knowing and the known?&rsquo;‚Äîor more shortly, &lsquo;What is knowledge?&rsquo;</p>
<h2 id="historical-and-philosophical-context-of-epistemology-1">Historical and Philosophical Context of Epistemology <a href="#historical-and-philosophical-context-of-epistemology-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Among the Ancient Greek philosophers, Plato distinguished between inquiry regarding what people know and inquiry regarding what exists, particularly in the Republic, the Theaetetus, and the Meno. In Meno, the definition of knowledge as justified true belief appears for the first time. In other words, belief is required to have an explanation in order to be correct, beyond just happening to be right. A number of important epistemological concerns also appeared in the works of Aristotle.</p>
<p>During the subsequent Hellenistic period, philosophical schools began to appear which had a greater focus on epistemological questions, often in the form of philosophical skepticism. For instance, the Hellenistic Sceptics, especially Sextus Empiricus of the Pyrrhonian school rejected justification on the basis of Agrippa&rsquo;s trilemma and so, in the view of Irwin (2010), rejected the  possibility of knowledge as well. The Pyrrhonian school of Pyrrho and Sextus Empiricus held that eudaimonia (flourishing, happiness, or &ldquo;the good life&rdquo;) could be attained through the application of epoch√© (suspension of judgment) regarding all non-evident matters. Pyrrhonism was particularly concerned with undermining the epistemological dogmas of Stoicism and Epicureanism. The other major school of Hellenistic skepticism was Academic skepticism, most notably defended by Carneades and Arcesilaus, which predominated in the Platonic Academy for almost two centuries.</p>
<p>In ancient India, the Aj√±ana school of ancient Indian philosophy promoted skepticism. Aj√±ana was a ≈örama·πáa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism, Jainism, and the ƒÄjƒ´vika school. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or to ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were specialized in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own.</p>
<p>After the ancient philosophical era but before the modern philosophical era, a number of Medieval philosophers also engaged with epistemological questions at length. Most notable among the Medievals for their contributions to epistemology were Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham.</p>
<p>During the Islamic Golden Age, one of the most prominent and influential philosophers, theologians, jurists, logicians, and mystics in Islamic epistemology was Al-Ghazali. During his life, he wrote over 70 books on science, Islamic reasoning, and Sufism. Al-Ghazali distributed his book The Incoherence of Philosophers, set apart as a defining moment in Islamic epistemology. He shaped a conviction that all occasions and relationships are not the result of material conjunctions but are the present and immediate will of God.</p>
<p>Epistemology largely came to the fore in philosophy during the early modern period, which historians of philosophy traditionally divide up into a dispute between empiricists (including Francis Bacon, John Locke, David Hume, and George Berkeley) and rationalists (including Ren√© Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, and Gottfried Leibniz). The debate between them has often been framed using the question of whether knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience (empiricism), or whether a significant portion of our knowledge is derived entirely from our faculty of reason (rationalism). According to some scholars, this dispute was resolved in the late 18th century by Immanuel Kant, whose transcendental idealism famously made room for the view that &ldquo;though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means follows that all [knowledge] arises out of experience&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="contemporary-historiography">Contemporary Historiography <a href="#contemporary-historiography" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>There are a number of different methods that contemporary scholars use when trying to understand the relationship between past epistemology and contemporary epistemology. One of the most contentious questions is this: &ldquo;Should we assume that the problems of epistemology are perennial, and that trying to reconstruct and evaluate Plato&rsquo;s or Hume&rsquo;s or Kant&rsquo;s arguments is meaningful for current debates, too?&rdquo; Similarly, there is also a question of whether contemporary philosophers should aim to rationally reconstruct and evaluate historical views in epistemology, or to merely describe them. Barry Stroud claims that doing epistemology competently requires the historical study of past attempts to find philosophical understanding of the nature and scope of human knowledge. He argues that since inquiry may progress over time, we may not realize how different the questions that contemporary epistemologists ask are from questions asked at various different points in the history of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="central-concepts-in-epistemology-2">Central Concepts in Epistemology <a href="#central-concepts-in-epistemology-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="knowledge-2">Knowledge <a href="#knowledge-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Nearly all debates in epistemology are in some way related to knowledge. Most generally, &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, which might include facts (propositional knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge). Philosophers tend to draw an important distinction between three different senses of &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; something: &ldquo;knowing that&rdquo; (knowing the truth of propositions), &ldquo;knowing how&rdquo; (understanding how to perform certain actions), and &ldquo;knowing by acquaintance&rdquo; (directly perceiving an object, being familiar with it, or otherwise coming into contact with it). Epistemology is primarily concerned with the first of these forms of knowledge, propositional knowledge. All three senses of &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; can be seen in our ordinary use of the word. In mathematics, you can know that 2 + 2 = 4, but there is also knowing how to add two numbers, and knowing a person (e.g., knowing other persons, or knowing oneself), place (e.g., one&rsquo;s hometown), thing (e.g., cars), or activity (e.g., addition). While these distinctions are not explicit in English, they are explicitly made in other languages, including French, Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, German and Dutch (although some languages closely related to English have been said to retain these verbs, such as Scots). The theoretical interpretation and significance of these linguistic issues remains controversial.</p>
<p>In his paper On Denoting and his later book Problems of Philosophy, Bertrand Russell brought a great deal of attention to the distinction between &ldquo;knowledge by description&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowledge by acquaintance&rdquo;. Gilbert Ryle is similarly credited with bringing more attention to the distinction between knowing how and knowing that in The Concept of Mind. In Personal Knowledge, Michael Polanyi argues for the epistemological relevance of knowledge how and knowledge that; using the example of the act of balance involved in riding a bicycle, he suggests that the theoretical knowledge of the physics involved in maintaining a state of balance cannot substitute for the practical knowledge of how to ride, and that it is important to understand how both are established and grounded. This position is essentially Ryle&rsquo;s, who argued that a failure to acknowledge the distinction between &ldquo;knowledge that&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowledge how&rdquo; leads to infinite regress.</p>
<h4 id="a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge-3">A priori and a posteriori knowledge <a href="#a-priori-and-a-posteriori-knowledge-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h4><p>One of the most important distinctions in epistemology is between what can be known a priori (independently of experience) and what can be known a posteriori (through experience). The terms originate from the Analytic methods of Aristotle&rsquo;s Organon, and may be roughly defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A priori knowledge is knowledge that is known independently of experience (that is, it is non-empirical, or arrived at before experience, usually by reason). It will henceforth be acquired through anything that is independent from experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A posteriori knowledge is knowledge that is known by experience (that is, it is empirical, or arrived at through experience).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Views that emphasize the importance of a priori knowledge are generally classified as rationalist. Views that emphasize the importance of a posteriori knowledge are generally classified as empiricist.</p>
<h3 id="belief-2">Belief <a href="#belief-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>One of the core concepts in epistemology is belief. A belief is an attitude that a person holds regarding anything that they take to be true. For instance, to believe that snow is white is comparable to accepting the truth of the proposition &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;. Beliefs can be occurrent (e.g. a person actively thinking &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;), or they can be dispositional (e.g. a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert &ldquo;snow is white&rdquo;). While there is not universal agreement about the nature of belief, most contemporary philosophers hold the view that a disposition to express belief B qualifies as holding the belief B. There are various different ways that contemporary philosophers have tried to describe beliefs, including as representations of ways that the world could be (Jerry Fodor), as dispositions to act as if certain things are true (Roderick Chisholm), as interpretive schemes for making sense of someone&rsquo;s actions (Daniel Dennett and Donald Davidson), or as mental states that fill a particular function (Hilary Putnam). Some have also attempted to offer significant revisions to our notion of belief, including eliminativists about belief who argue that there is no phenomenon in the natural world which corresponds to our folk psychological concept of belief (Paul Churchland) and formal epistemologists who aim to replace our bivalent notion of belief (&ldquo;either I have a belief or I don&rsquo;t have a belief&rdquo;) with the more permissive, probabilistic notion of credence (&ldquo;there is an entire spectrum of degrees of belief, not a simple dichotomy between belief and non-belief&rdquo;).</p>
<p>While belief plays a significant role in epistemological debates surrounding knowledge and justification, it also has many other philosophical debates in its own right. Notable debates include: &ldquo;What is the rational way to revise one&rsquo;s beliefs when presented with various sorts of evidence?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Is the content of our beliefs entirely determined by our mental states, or do the relevant facts have any bearing on our beliefs (e.g. if I believe that I&rsquo;m holding a glass of water, is the non-mental fact that water is H2O part of the content of that belief)?&rdquo;; &ldquo;How fine-grained or coarse-grained are our beliefs?&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Must it be possible for a belief to be expressible in language, or are there non-linguistic beliefs?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="truth-2">Truth <a href="#truth-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Truth is the property or state of being in accordance with facts or reality. On most views, truth is the correspondence of language or thought to a mind-independent world. This is called the correspondence theory of truth. Among philosophers who think that it is possible to analyze the conditions necessary for knowledge, virtually all of them accept that truth is such a condition. There is much less agreement about the extent to which a knower must know why something is true in order to know. On such views, something being known implies that it is true. However, this should not be confused for the more contentious view that one must know that one knows in order to know (the KK principle).</p>
<p>Epistemologists disagree about whether belief is the only truth-bearer. Other common suggestions for things that can bear the property of being true include propositions, sentences, thoughts, utterances, and judgments. Plato, in his Gorgias, argues that belief is the most commonly invoked truth-bearer.</p>
<p>Many of the debates regarding truth are at the crossroads of epistemology and logic. Some contemporary debates regarding truth include: How do we define truth? Is it even possible to give an informative definition of truth? What things are truth-bearers and are therefore capable of being true or false? Are truth and falsity bivalent, or are there other truth values? What are the criteria of truth that allow us to identify it and to distinguish it from falsity? What role does truth play in constituting knowledge? And is truth absolute, or is it merely relative to one&rsquo;s perspective?</p>
<h3 id="justification-2">Justification <a href="#justification-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>As the term &ldquo;justification&rdquo; is used in epistemology, a belief is justified if one has good reason for holding it. Loosely speaking, justification is the reason that someone holds a rationally admissible belief, on the assumption that it is a good reason for holding it. Sources of justification might include perceptual experience (the evidence of the senses), reason, and authoritative testimony, among others. Importantly however, a belief being justified does not guarantee that the belief is true, since a person could be justified in forming beliefs based on very convincing evidence that was nonetheless deceiving.</p>
<h4 id="internalism-and-externalism-2">Internalism and externalism <a href="#internalism-and-externalism-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h4><p>A central debate about the nature of justification is a debate between epistemological externalists on the one hand and epistemological internalists on the other. While epistemic externalism first arose in attempts to overcome the Gettier problem, it has flourished in the time since as an alternative way of conceiving of epistemic justification. The initial development of epistemic externalism is often attributed to Alvin Goldman, although numerous others have contributed to its development and refinement.</p>

<p>The European Union (EU) makes laws through different methods. The way they choose depends on what the law is about. Usually, the European Commission suggests a law, and then the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament decide if they agree. Over time, the European Parliament has gained more power to help make laws. Only member states can change the EU&rsquo;s main laws, and they all have to agree to the changes.</p>
<p>Three main groups help make EU laws: the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission. National parliaments of EU countries also play a role. The European Commission usually starts the law-making process. The European Parliament, which is made up of members chosen by people living in the EU, works with the Council to make laws. The Council represents the governments of EU countries.</p>
<p>When a law is suggested, it goes through several readings and votes by the Parliament and the Council. If they can&rsquo;t agree, a special committee tries to find a solution. If they still can&rsquo;t agree, the law is not passed.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the EU uses a quicker method called a &ldquo;trilogue&rdquo; to agree on laws. This involves representatives from the Parliament, the Council, and the Commission.</p>
<p>There are also special methods for making laws about sensitive topics. In some cases, the Council can make a law after getting the Parliament&rsquo;s opinion. In other cases, the Council can make a law after the Parliament agrees to it.</p>
<p>The EU can also change its main laws in two ways. One way is similar to the usual law-making process, but involves a conference of representatives from each member state&rsquo;s government. The other way allows the European Council to make changes to certain parts of the main laws, as long as all member states agree and the changes don&rsquo;t affect the EU&rsquo;s powers.</p>

<h1 id="how-the-european-union-makes-laws">How the European Union Makes Laws <a href="#how-the-european-union-makes-laws" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The European Union (EU) creates laws using different procedures. The type of procedure used depends on the topic of the law. The European Commission usually proposes the law, and then the Council of the European Union and European Parliament have to approve it to make it official. Over time, the European Parliament has gotten more power in making laws. It used to just give advice, but now it helps make the laws with the Council. The member countries of the EU have the power to change the Treaties of the EU, which are like the main rules of the EU. However, they have to agree to these changes based on their own country&rsquo;s rules.</p>
<h1 id="who-helps-make-eu-laws">Who Helps Make EU Laws <a href="#who-helps-make-eu-laws" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Since 2009, three main groups have been involved in making EU laws: the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission. The national parliaments of the EU countries also play a role. The Parliament and the Council share the job of making laws and deciding on the budget for the EU. The European Commission has a lot of control over what laws are proposed. The European Parliament is made up of 705 members who are chosen by the people every five years. The Council of the EU represents the governments of the member countries. The national parliaments of the EU countries can raise objections if they think a law goes against the principle of subsidiarity, which means that decisions should be made as close as possible to the citizens.</p>
<h1 id="how-eu-laws-are-passed">How EU Laws are Passed <a href="#how-eu-laws-are-passed" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The main way that laws are passed in the EU is called the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission proposes a law to the Parliament and Council. The Parliament then adopts its position. If the Council agrees with the Parliament, the law is adopted. If not, the Council adopts its own position and sends it back to Parliament with explanations. The Parliament can reject the Council&rsquo;s text, modify it and pass it back to the Council. If the Council approves the Parliament&rsquo;s new text within three months, the law is adopted. If it doesn&rsquo;t, a Conciliation Committee is set up to try and agree on a joint text. If the Committee can&rsquo;t agree on a text within six weeks, the law is not adopted. If it does agree and the text is approved by the Council and Parliament, the law is adopted. There are also special legislative procedures for sensitive areas, and non-legislative procedures where the Commission and Council can adopt legal acts without the Parliament. The treaties can also be revised using an ordinary revision procedure or a simplified revision procedure.</p>

<h1 id="making-laws-in-the-european-union">Making Laws in the European Union <a href="#making-laws-in-the-european-union" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The European Union (EU) is a group of 27 countries in Europe that work together in many ways. One of the things they do together is make laws. This process involves different groups and follows certain rules and steps. Let&rsquo;s explore how this works!</p>
<h2 id="section-1-who-makes-the-laws">Section 1: Who Makes the Laws? <a href="#section-1-who-makes-the-laws" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The main groups involved in making EU laws are the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission. Each of these groups has a different role in the process. Let&rsquo;s learn about each one!</p>
<h3 id="the-european-commission">The European Commission <a href="#the-european-commission" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The European Commission is like the ideas factory for EU laws. They are the ones who usually come up with the ideas for new laws. They then write these ideas down in a way that can be turned into a law. This is called a legislative proposal.</p>
<p>The Commission has a lot of power in deciding what these proposals look like. Sometimes, they create proposals because the Council or the Parliament has asked them to. But, they get to decide exactly what the proposal says.</p>
<p>There are also some cases where the Commission can create laws by itself, without needing approval from the other groups. But, this doesn&rsquo;t happen very often.</p>
<h3 id="the-european-parliament">The European Parliament <a href="#the-european-parliament" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The European Parliament is made up of 705 members who are chosen by people from all over the EU. These members work together in groups based on their political beliefs, not the country they&rsquo;re from.</p>
<p>The Parliament&rsquo;s job is to review the proposals from the Commission and decide if they agree with them. Over time, the Parliament has gotten more power in this process. Now, they have an equal role with the Council in making laws.</p>
<p>The Parliament also gets to vote on who is in the European Commission. But, they don&rsquo;t get to pick the candidates. That&rsquo;s up to the Council of the European Union.</p>
<h3 id="the-council-of-the-european-union">The Council of the European Union <a href="#the-council-of-the-european-union" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The Council of the European Union represents the governments of the EU countries. They have as many members as there are countries in the EU (27). Each country gets a certain number of votes based on how many people live there.</p>
<p>The Council&rsquo;s job is to review the legislative proposals too. They work on this mostly through their representatives, rather than in committees like the Parliament.</p>
<h3 id="national-parliaments">National Parliaments <a href="#national-parliaments" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The national parliaments of the EU countries also play a role in making laws. They have a system where they can raise objections to a proposal if they think it goes against the principle of subsidiarity. This principle says that decisions should be made as close to the people as possible.</p>
<p>If one third of the national parliaments object to a proposal, it has to be reviewed. If more than half object, the Council or the Parliament can vote it down right away. This gives the national parliaments some power in the law-making process.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-how-are-laws-made">Section 2: How Are Laws Made? <a href="#section-2-how-are-laws-made" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Now that we know who makes the laws, let&rsquo;s look at how they do it. The main way laws are made in the EU is through the ordinary legislative procedure. This used to be called the codecision procedure.</p>
<h3 id="the-ordinary-legislative-procedure">The Ordinary Legislative Procedure <a href="#the-ordinary-legislative-procedure" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Here&rsquo;s how the ordinary legislative procedure works, step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Commission creates a legislative proposal and sends it to the Parliament and the Council.</li>
<li>The Parliament reviews the proposal and decides if they agree with it. If the Council agrees with the Parliament&rsquo;s decision, the proposal becomes a law.</li>
<li>If the Council doesn&rsquo;t agree with the Parliament, they create their own version of the proposal and send it back to the Parliament. The Commission also tells the Parliament what they think about the Council&rsquo;s version.</li>
<li>The Parliament then reviews the Council&rsquo;s version. If they agree with it, or if they don&rsquo;t make a decision, the proposal becomes a law. If they don&rsquo;t agree, they can change the proposal and send it back to the Council. The Commission tells the Council what they think about the Parliament&rsquo;s changes.</li>
<li>If the Council agrees with the Parliament&rsquo;s changes within three months, the proposal becomes a law. If they don&rsquo;t agree, they meet with the Parliament in a group called the Conciliation Committee to try to agree on a final version.</li>
<li>If the Committee can&rsquo;t agree on a version, the proposal does not become a law. If they do agree, and the Council and the Parliament approve their version, the proposal becomes a law.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process was created to replace an older process called the Cooperation procedure. It&rsquo;s now used for almost all areas, like agriculture, fishing, transportation, and the budget.</p>
<h3 id="the-trilogue">The Trilogue <a href="#the-trilogue" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>During the ordinary legislative procedure, there&rsquo;s often a meeting called a trilogue. This is an informal meeting between representatives from the Parliament, the Council, and the Commission.</p>
<p>The goal of the trilogue is to help the three groups agree on a proposal more quickly. The agreements made in these meetings still have to be approved through the regular process in each group.</p>
<p>Trilogues have become more common as the Parliament&rsquo;s role in making laws has grown. But, some people have criticized them for not being transparent enough.</p>
<h2 id="section-3-special-procedures">Section 3: Special Procedures <a href="#section-3-special-procedures" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Sometimes, special procedures are used to make laws in certain sensitive areas. These procedures only involve the Council and either the Parliament or the Commission.</p>
<h3 id="consultation-procedure">Consultation Procedure <a href="#consultation-procedure" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In the consultation procedure, the Council can make a law based on a proposal from the Commission after consulting with the Parliament. But, they don&rsquo;t have to agree with what the Parliament says.</p>
<h3 id="consent-procedure">Consent Procedure <a href="#consent-procedure" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In the consent procedure, the Council can make a law based on a proposal from the Commission after getting the Parliament&rsquo;s consent. The Parliament can&rsquo;t suggest changes to the proposal, but they can refuse to give their consent if they don&rsquo;t agree with it.</p>
<h2 id="section-4-non-legislative-procedures">Section 4: Non-Legislative Procedures <a href="#section-4-non-legislative-procedures" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>There are also some procedures for making non-legislative acts. These are acts that have legal effects, but they&rsquo;re not laws.</p>
<h3 id="commission-and-council-acting-alone">Commission and Council Acting Alone <a href="#commission-and-council-acting-alone" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In some cases, the Council can adopt acts proposed by the Commission without needing the Parliament&rsquo;s opinion. This is used for things like setting tariffs and negotiating trade agreements.</p>
<h3 id="commission-acting-alone">Commission Acting Alone <a href="#commission-acting-alone" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In a few areas, the Commission can adopt acts on its own, without consulting with or getting consent from the other groups. This is used for things like regulating monopolies and worker rights.</p>
<h2 id="section-5-changing-the-treaties">Section 5: Changing the Treaties <a href="#section-5-changing-the-treaties" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The EU is based on several treaties, which are like its constitution. Changing these treaties is a big deal and requires a special process.</p>
<p>There are two ways to change the treaties: the ordinary revision procedure and the simplified revision procedure. The ordinary procedure involves a conference with representatives from all the member states. The simplified procedure can be used to change certain parts of the treaties with a unanimous decision from the European Council and approval from all the member states.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a clause called the Passerelle Clause that allows the European Council to change how decisions are made in the Council of Ministers. They can switch from unanimous voting to majority voting in certain areas with the Parliament&rsquo;s consent.</p>

<p>The European Union (EU) creates laws through various legislative procedures, depending on the policy area. Most legislation must be proposed by the European Commission and approved by the Council of the European Union and European Parliament to become law.

<h1 id="european-union-legislative-procedures">European Union Legislative Procedures <a href="#european-union-legislative-procedures" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The European Union (EU) has a complex system for creating and adopting legislation. The process can vary depending on the policy area in question. Typically, the European Commission proposes most legislation which then needs to be approved by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament to become law. Over time, the European Parliament&rsquo;s role in the legislative process has grown significantly. It has evolved from merely providing non-binding opinions to participating equally with the Council in the legislative process. In addition, the power to amend the Treaties of the European Union, sometimes referred to as the Union&rsquo;s primary law, is reserved to the member states and must be ratified by them according to their constitutional requirements.</p>
<h1 id="key-participants-in-the-legislative-process">Key Participants in the Legislative Process <a href="#key-participants-in-the-legislative-process" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Since the Lisbon Treaty came into force in December 2009, the main participants in the EU legislative process have been the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission. The national parliaments of the EU also play a role. The European Commission has significant influence as it has a virtual monopoly on introducing legislation into the process. The European Parliament&rsquo;s 705 members are directly elected every five years and play a crucial role in the legislative process. The Council of the European Union represents the national governments of member states, and its composition reflects the number of member states. The national parliaments of EU member states have an &ldquo;early warning mechanism&rdquo; that allows them to raise objections if they believe the principle of subsidiarity has been violated.</p>
<h1 id="ordinary-and-special-legislative-procedures">Ordinary and Special Legislative Procedures <a href="#ordinary-and-special-legislative-procedures" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The ordinary legislative procedure is the main method by which directives and regulations are adopted. This procedure involves the Commission submitting a legislative proposal to the Parliament and Council. If the Council approves the Parliament&rsquo;s wording, the act is adopted. If not, the Council adopts its own position and passes it back to Parliament with explanations. If the Council and Parliament fail to agree on a common text, the act is not adopted. Special legislative procedures are used in sensitive areas. These procedures see the Council adopt legislation alone with just the involvement of the other. Notable procedures include the consultation and consent procedures. In the consultation procedure, the Council can adopt legislation based on a proposal by the European Commission after consulting the European Parliament. In the consent procedure, the Council can adopt legislation based on a proposal by the European Commission after obtaining the consent of Parliament.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-the-european-union-legislative-procedures">Understanding the European Union Legislative Procedures <a href="#understanding-the-european-union-legislative-procedures" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states located in Europe. It has a complex system of law and governance, which is made up of several legislative procedures. These procedures are the methods by which the EU adopts new laws and amends existing ones. Let&rsquo;s break down how this process works.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-eu-legislative-procedures">Overview of EU Legislative Procedures <a href="#overview-of-eu-legislative-procedures" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The legislative procedures in the EU are the processes through which the EU creates new laws or changes existing ones. The type of procedure used depends on the policy area in question. Most legislation needs to be proposed by the European Commission and approved by the Council of the European Union and European Parliament to become law.</p>
<p>Over the years, the European Parliament has gained more power in the legislative process. It went from having a limited role, where it could only give a non-binding opinion, to participating equally with the Council in the legislative process.</p>
<p>The power to amend the Treaties of the European Union, which are like the EU&rsquo;s constitution, is reserved to the member states. These changes must be ratified by the member states according to their own constitutional requirements. However, there are exceptions to this rule, known as &ldquo;passerelle clauses&rdquo;, where the legislative procedure used for a certain policy area can be changed without formally amending the treaties.</p>
<h2 id="key-participants-in-the-legislative-process-1">Key Participants in the Legislative Process <a href="#key-participants-in-the-legislative-process-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Since December 2009, after the Lisbon Treaty came into force, three EU institutions have been the main participants in the legislative process: the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission. The national parliaments of the EU member states also play a role.</p>
<h3 id="european-commission">European Commission <a href="#european-commission" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The European Commission has a significant role in the legislative process. It is the only body that can propose new legislation. This power gives the Commission considerable influence as it sets the agenda for the EU. The Commission often introduces legislation at the request of the Council or upon the suggestion of Parliament. However, the form that these legislative proposals take is up to the Commission.</p>
<h3 id="european-parliament">European Parliament <a href="#european-parliament" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The European Parliament has 705 members who are directly elected every five years by universal suffrage, which means that all adult citizens have the right to vote. The Parliament organises itself as a typical multi-party parliament, conducting most of its work in committees and sitting in political groupings. Over time, the Parliament&rsquo;s powers have grown significantly, and it now has more equality with the Council in the legislative process.</p>
<h3 id="council-of-the-european-union">Council of the European Union <a href="#council-of-the-european-union" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The Council of the European Union represents the national governments of the EU member states. Its composition is essentially the number of member states (27), though votes are weighted according to the population of each state. Unlike the Parliament, the Council does not sit according to political groups and conducts much of its work through diplomatic representatives.</p>
<h3 id="national-parliaments-1">National Parliaments <a href="#national-parliaments-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The national parliaments of EU member states have an &ldquo;early warning mechanism&rdquo;. If one third of them raise an objection ‚Äì a &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; ‚Äì on the basis that the principle of subsidiarity has been violated, then the proposal must be reviewed. If a majority do so ‚Äì an &ldquo;orange card&rdquo; ‚Äì then the Council or Parliament can vote it down immediately.</p>
<h2 id="ordinary-legislative-procedure">Ordinary Legislative Procedure <a href="#ordinary-legislative-procedure" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The ordinary legislative procedure is the main legislative procedure by which directives and regulations are adopted. The Commission submits a legislative proposal to the Parliament and Council. At the first reading, Parliament adopts its position. If the Council approves the Parliament&rsquo;s wording then the act is adopted. If not, it shall adopt its own position and pass it back to Parliament with explanations.</p>
<p>If, within three months of receiving Parliament&rsquo;s new text, the Council approves it, then it is adopted. If it does not, a Conciliation Committee composed of the Council and an equal number of MEPs is convened. The committee draws up a joint text on the basis of the two positions. If within six weeks it fails to agree on a common text, then the act has failed. If it succeeds and the committee approves the text, then the Council and Parliament must then approve the text. If either fails to do so, the act is not adopted.</p>
<h3 id="trilogue">Trilogue <a href="#trilogue" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The trilogue is an informal type of meeting used in the EU&rsquo;s ordinary legislative procedure. It involves representatives of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and the European Commission. The trilogue negotiations aim at bringing the three institutions to an agreement, to fast-track the ordinary legislative procedure. However, the agreements reached in trilogues need to be approved through the formal procedures of each of the three institutions.</p>
<h2 id="special-legislative-procedures">Special Legislative Procedures <a href="#special-legislative-procedures" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The treaties have provision for special legislative procedures to be used in sensitive areas.

While being required to consult Parliament on legislative proposals, the Council is not bound by Parliament&rsquo;s position.</p>
<h3 id="consent-procedure-1">Consent Procedure <a href="#consent-procedure-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In the consent procedure, the Council can adopt legislation based on a proposal by the European Commission after obtaining the consent of Parliament.

<h2 id="non-legislative-procedures">Non-legislative Procedures <a href="#non-legislative-procedures" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>In some cases, the Commission and Council can adopt legal acts proposed by the Commission without requiring the opinion of Parliament.

<h2 id="treaty-revisions">Treaty Revisions <a href="#treaty-revisions" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The 2009 Lisbon Treaty created two different ways for further amendments of the European Union treaties: an ordinary revision procedure and a simplified revision procedure. The Treaty also provides for the Passerelle Clause which allows the European Council to unanimously decide to replace unanimous voting in the Council of Ministers with qualified majority voting in specified areas with the previous consent of the European Parliament, and move from a special legislative procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure.</p>

<h1 id="eu-legislative-procedures-and-participants">EU Legislative Procedures and Participants <a href="#eu-legislative-procedures-and-participants" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The European Union (EU) adopts legislation through various procedures, with the specific procedure used depending on the policy area in question. The majority of legislation needs to be proposed by the European Commission and approved by the Council of the European Union and European Parliament to become law. Over time, the European Parliament&rsquo;s power within the legislative process has increased significantly. The power to amend the Treaties of the European Union, often referred to as the Union&rsquo;s primary law, is reserved to the member states and must be ratified by them according to their respective constitutional requirements.</p>
<p>The main participants in the legislative process since the Lisbon Treaty came into force in December 2009 are the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission. National parliaments of the EU also play a role. The legislative and budgetary functions of the union are jointly exercised by the Parliament and the Council. The European Union&rsquo;s unique dynamics between the legislative bodies have led to extensive academic debate about its organization, with some categorizing the EU as bicameral or tricameral.</p>
<h1 id="ordinary-legislative-procedure-and-trilogue">Ordinary Legislative Procedure and Trilogue <a href="#ordinary-legislative-procedure-and-trilogue" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The ordinary legislative procedure is the main legislative procedure by which directives and regulations are adopted.

If the Council approves the Parliament&rsquo;s wording, then the act is adopted. If not, it shall adopt its own position and pass it back to Parliament with explanations. The Commission also informs Parliament of its position on the matter. The act is adopted if Parliament approves the Council&rsquo;s text or fails to take a decision.</p>
<p>The trilogue is an informal type of meeting used in the EU&rsquo;s ordinary legislative procedure. It involves representatives of the European Parliament (EP), the Council of the EU, and the European Commission. The trilogue negotiations aim at bringing the three institutions to an agreement, to fast-track the ordinary legislative procedure.

The type of procedure used for any given legislative proposal depends on the policy area in question. The majority of legislation needs to be proposed by the European Commission and approved by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament to become law.</p>
<p>Over the years, the power of the European Parliament within the legislative process has significantly increased. It has evolved from being limited to giving its non-binding opinion or being excluded from the legislative process altogether, to participating equally with the Council in the legislative process.</p>
<p>The power to amend the Treaties of the European Union, sometimes referred to as the Union&rsquo;s primary law, or even as its de facto constitution, is reserved to the member states and must be ratified by them in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. An exception to this are so-called passerelle clauses in which the legislative procedure used for a certain policy area can be changed without formally amending the treaties.</p>
<h2 id="participants-in-the-eu-legislative-process">Participants in the EU Legislative Process <a href="#participants-in-the-eu-legislative-process" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Since December 2009, after the Lisbon Treaty came into force, three EU institutions have been the main participants in the legislative process: the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission. The national parliaments of the EU also play a role. The legislative and budgetary functions of the union are jointly exercised by the Parliament and the Council, which are referred to as the Union legislator in a protocol to the EU treaties.</p>
<p>The precise nature of this organisation has been discussed extensively in academic literature, with some categorising the European Union as bicameral or tricameral. However, the European Union itself has not accepted such categorisation and it is generally considered to be sui generis by observers, given the unique dynamics between the legislative bodies not found in traditional tricameralism.</p>
<h3 id="european-commission-1">European Commission <a href="#european-commission-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The Commission has a virtual monopoly on the introduction of legislation into the legislative process, a power which gives the Commission considerable influence as an agenda setter for the EU as a whole. While the Commission frequently introduces legislation at the behest of the Council or upon the suggestion of Parliament, the form any legislative proposals introduced take is up to the Commission. Under the ordinary legislative procedure, a negative opinion from the Commission forces the Council to vote by unanimity rather than majority except when a conciliation committee has been set up. There are also limited instances where the Commission can adopt legislation without the approval of other bodies.</p>
<h3 id="european-parliament-1">European Parliament <a href="#european-parliament-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The European Parliament&rsquo;s 705 members are directly elected every five years by universal suffrage. It organises itself as a normal multi-party parliament in conducting most of its work in its committees and sitting in political groupings rather than national delegations. However, its political groups are very weak due to their status as broad ideological groups of existing national parties.</p>
<p>The Parliament&rsquo;s powers have grown considerably since the 1950s as new legislative procedures granted more equality between Parliament and Council. It has also become a requirement that the composition of the European Commission be subject to a vote of approval as a whole by the Parliament. However, the choice of candidates remains the jurisdiction of the Council of the European Union, and the European Commission retains the sole power of legislative initiative.</p>
<h3 id="council-of-the-european-union-1">Council of the European Union <a href="#council-of-the-european-union-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The Council of the EU, also known as &ldquo;the council of ministers&rdquo; and simply &ldquo;the council&rdquo;, represents the national governments of member states. Its composition is essentially the number of member states (27), though votes are weighted according to the population of each state. As such, it does not sit according to political groups and rather than conducting most of its work in committees, much of its work is prepared by diplomatic representatives (COREPER).</p>
<h3 id="national-parliaments-2">National Parliaments <a href="#national-parliaments-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The national parliaments of EU member states have an &ldquo;early warning mechanism&rdquo; whereby if one third raise an objection ‚Äì a &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; ‚Äì on the basis that the principle of subsidiarity has been violated, then the proposal must be reviewed. If a majority do so ‚Äì an &ldquo;orange card&rdquo; ‚Äì then the Council or Parliament can vote it down immediately. If the logistical problems of putting this into practice are overcome, then the power of the national parliaments could be decried as an extra legislature, without a common debate or physical location: dubbed by EU Observer a &ldquo;virtual third chamber&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="ordinary-legislative-procedure-1">Ordinary Legislative Procedure <a href="#ordinary-legislative-procedure-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The ordinary legislative procedure is the main legislative procedure by which directives and regulations are adopted. It was formerly known as the codecision procedure, and is sometimes referred to as the &lsquo;community method&rsquo; as a contrast to the &lsquo;intergovernmental methods&rsquo; which can variously refer to the consultation procedure or to the open method of co-ordination.</p>
<p>Article 294 TFEU outlines ordinary legislative procedure in the following manner. The Commission submits a legislative proposal to the Parliament and Council. At the first reading Parliament adopts its position. If the Council approves the Parliament&rsquo;s wording then the act is adopted. If not, it shall adopt its own position and pass it back to Parliament with explanations. The Commission also informs Parliament of its position on the matter.</p>
<p>At the second reading, the act is adopted if Parliament approves the Council&rsquo;s text or fails to take a decision. The Parliament may reject the Council&rsquo;s text, leading to a failure of the law, or modify it and pass it back to the Council. The Commission gives its opinion once more. Where the Commission has rejected amendments in its opinion, the Council must act unanimously rather than by majority.</p>
<p>If, within three months of receiving Parliament&rsquo;s new text, the Council approves it, then it is adopted. If it does not, the Council President, with the agreement of the Parliament President, convenes the Conciliation Committee composed of the Council and an equal number of MEPs (with the attendance as moderator of the Commission). The committee draws up a joint text on the basis of the two positions. If within six weeks it fails to agree a common text, then the act has failed. If it succeeds and the committee approves the text, then the Council and Parliament (acting by majority) must then approve said text (third reading). If either fails to do so, the act is not adopted.</p>
<p>The procedure was introduced with the Maastricht Treaty as the codecision procedure and was initially intended to replace the Cooperation procedure. The codecision procedure was amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the number of legal bases where the procedure applies was greatly increased by both the latter treaty and the Treaty of Nice. It was renamed the ordinary legislative procedure and extended to nearly all areas such as agriculture, fisheries, transport, structural funds, the entire budget and the former third pillar by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<h3 id="trilogue-1">Trilogue <a href="#trilogue-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The trilogue is an informal type of meeting used in the EU&rsquo;s ordinary legislative procedure. It involves representatives of the European Parliament (EP), the Council of the EU and the European Commission. The trilogues are equally tripartite meetings, although the EC operates as a mediator between the EP and the Council.</p>
<p>The trilogue negotiations aim at bringing the three institutions to an agreement, to fast-track the ordinary legislative procedure. The expression &ldquo;formal trilogue&rdquo; is sometimes used to describe meetings of the Conciliation Committee, which take place between the second and the third reading of a legislative proposal. However the term trilogue is mostly referred to interinstitutional informal negotiations that can take place in any stage of the ordinary legislative procedure, from the first stage to the stage of the formal conciliation procedure.</p>
<p>However, the agreements reached in trilogues need to be approved through the formal procedures of each of the three institutions. Trilogues have been &ldquo;formalised&rdquo; in 2007 in a joint declaration of the EP, the Council and the EC but they are not regulated by primary legislation.</p>
<p>The evolution of the European integration process, together with the evolution of EP&rsquo;s role as co-legislator have produced an increase in the number of the trilogue meetings. During 2009‚Äì2014 legislative term, when the Treaty of Lisbon came into force and the co-decision procedure became ordinary legislative procedure ‚Äì establishing the role of the EP and the Council of the EU as co-legislators ‚Äì 85% of legislative acts were approved in first reading, 13% were approved in second reading while only 2% were included in the conciliation procedure. This trend corresponds to an increase in the number of trilogues (over 1500 in the same period) and it is seen as a proof of the effectiveness of the trilogues in fast tracking the legislative procedure.</p>
<p>The principal tool used in trilogues is the four column document, a working sheet divided in four sections, each of them comprising the positions of the three EU institutions. The first column is dedicated to the position of the EC, the second one to the position of the EP, the third one to the position of the Council. The fourth and final column is left to the compromised text that is meant to emerge. However, although the first two positions are public, the other two have often textual elements that have not been adopted and the content of the fourth column remains inaccessible to public.</p>
<p>Trilogues have been criticised for the lack of transparency and democraticness both for the limited number of EU representatives involved and the working methods. The European Ombudsman, the EU body responsible of investigating complaints about poor administration by EU institutions and other bodies, in 2015 has launched a strategic inquiry to establish the need for a reform of the trilogue, setting out proposals for more transparency.</p>
<h2 id="special-legislative-procedures-1">Special Legislative Procedures <a href="#special-legislative-procedures-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The treaties have provision for special legislative procedures to be used in sensitive areas. These see the Council adopt alone with just the involvement of the other. Notable procedures are the consultation and consent procedures, though various others are used for specific cases.</p>
<h3 id="consultation-procedure-2">Consultation Procedure <a href="#consultation-procedure-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Under this procedure the Council, acting either unanimously or by a qualified majority depending on the policy area concerned, can adopt legislation based on a proposal by the European Commission after consulting the European Parliament. While being required to consult Parliament on legislative proposals, the Council is not bound by Parliament&rsquo;s position. In practice the Council would frequently ignore whatever Parliament might suggest and even sometimes reach an agreement before receiving Parliament&rsquo;s opinion. However, the European Court of Justice has ruled that the Council must wait for Parliament&rsquo;s opinion and the Court has struck down legislation that the Council adopted before Parliament gave its opinion.</p>
<p>Before the Single European Act the Consultation procedure was the most widely used legislative procedure in the then European Community. Consultation is still used for legislation concerning internal market exemptions and competition law. The procedure is also used in relation to the Union&rsquo;s advisory bodies such as the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee that are required to be consulted under a range of areas under the treaties affecting their area of expertise. Such a procedure takes place in addition to consultation with the European Parliament or the other legislative procedures.</p>
<h3 id="consent-procedure-2">Consent Procedure <a href="#consent-procedure-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In the consent procedure (formerly assent procedure), the Council can adopt legislation based on a proposal by the European Commission after obtaining the consent of Parliament. Thus Parliament has the legal power to accept or reject any proposal but no legal mechanism exists for proposing amendments. Parliament has however provided for conciliation committee and a procedure for giving interim reports where it can address its concerns to the Council and threaten to withhold its consent unless its concerns are met. This applies to admission of members, methods of withdrawal, subsidiary general legal basis provision and combating discrimination.</p>
<h2 id="non-legislative-procedures-1">Non-Legislative Procedures <a href="#non-legislative-procedures-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="commission-and-council-acting-alone-1">Commission and Council Acting Alone <a href="#commission-and-council-acting-alone-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Under this procedure the Council can adopt legal acts proposed by the Commission without requiring the opinion of Parliament. The procedure is used when setting the common external tariff (Article 31 (ex Article 26)) and for negotiating trade agreements under the EU&rsquo;s Common Commercial Policy (Article 207(3)). However, formally speaking these acts are not legislative acts.</p>
<h3 id="commission-acting-alone-1">Commission Acting Alone <a href="#commission-acting-alone-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>In a few limited areas, the Commission has the authority to adopt regulatory or technical legislation without consulting or obtaining the consent of other bodies. The Commission can adopt legal acts on its own initiative concerning monopolies and concessions granted to companies by Member States and concerning the right of workers to remain in a Member State after having been employed there (Article 45(3)(d) TFEU). Two directives have been adopted using this procedure: one on transparency between member states and companies and another on competition in the telecommunications sector. Formally speaking, these acts are not legislative acts.</p>
<h2 id="treaty-revisions-1">Treaty Revisions <a href="#treaty-revisions-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The 2009 Lisbon Treaty created two different ways for further amendments of the European Union treaties: an ordinary revision procedure which is broadly similar to the past revision process in that it involves convening an intergovernmental conference, and a simplified revision procedure whereby Part three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which deals with internal policy and action of the Union, could be amended by a unanimous decision of the European Council, provided there is no change to the field of competence of the EU, and subject to ratification by all member states in the usual manner.</p>
<p>The Treaty also provides for the Passerelle Clause which allows the European Council to unanimously decide to replace unanimous voting in the Council of Ministers with qualified majority voting in specified areas with the previous consent of the European Parliament, and move from a special legislative procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure.</p>
<h3 id="ordinary-revision-procedure">Ordinary Revision Procedure <a href="#ordinary-revision-procedure" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Proposals to amend the treaties are submitted by a Member State, the European Parliament or the European Commission to the Council of Ministers who, in turn, submit them to the European Council and notify member states. There are no limits on what kind of amendments can be proposed.</p>
<p>The European Council, after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission, votes to consider the proposals on the basis of a simple majority, and then either:</p>
<p>The President of the European Council convenes a convention containing representatives of national parliaments, governments, the European Parliament and the European Commission, to further consider the proposals. In due course, the convention submits its final recommendation to the European Council.</p>
<p>Or the European Council decides, with the agreement of the European Parliament, not to convene a convention and sets the terms of reference for the inter-governmental conference itself.</p>
<p>The President of the European Council convenes an inter-governmental conference consisting of representatives of each member-state&rsquo;s government. The conference drafts and finalises a treaty based on the convention&rsquo;s recommendations. The treaty must then be ratified by all member states to enter into force.</p>

<p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is a big dam being built on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia. It&rsquo;s meant to produce electricity for Ethiopia and its neighboring countries, and when it&rsquo;s finished, it will be the biggest hydroelectric power plant in Africa. The dam is being filled with water in phases, and it started producing electricity for the first time in February 2022.

<h1 id="the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam">The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam <a href="#the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is a big dam being built on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia. It started being built in 2011 and when it&rsquo;s finished, it will be the biggest power plant in Africa that makes electricity from water, also known as hydroelectric power. The dam is being built to help Ethiopia with its need for more electricity and to sell electricity to neighboring countries. The dam is being filled with water in stages. The first stage began in July 2020 and the third stage was completed in August 2022. The dam started producing electricity for the first time in February 2022.</p>
<p>The Blue Nile River is very important in Ethiopia and is often referred to as &rsquo;the river of rivers&rsquo;. The place where the dam is being built was identified by the United States Bureau of Reclamation between 1956 and 1964. However, because of wars in Ethiopia, the project didn&rsquo;t start until much later. The dam was originally called &ldquo;Project X&rdquo;, then the &ldquo;Millennium Dam&rdquo;, and finally the &ldquo;Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam&rdquo;. The dam is being paid for by the Ethiopian government and private donations.</p>
<p>There has been some disagreement about the dam. Egypt, which is downstream from the dam, is worried that the dam will reduce the amount of water available from the Nile River. Ethiopia disagrees and says the dam will actually increase water flows to Egypt. There have been many talks and negotiations between the countries about the dam.</p>
<h1 id="the-design-and-cost-of-the-dam">The Design and Cost of the Dam <a href="#the-design-and-cost-of-the-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The design of the dam has changed several times since 2011. The dam is expected to cost close to 5 billion US dollars. Because of Egypt&rsquo;s control over the Nile water share, Ethiopia has had to pay for the dam by selling bonds and asking employees to contribute part of their incomes. The dam is made up of two parts, the main dam and a smaller dam called a saddle dam. The dam will have three spillways, which are passages for surplus water to flow over.</p>
<p>The dam will have two powerhouses that will be equipped with 13 turbines. These turbines will generate electricity. The electricity will then be delivered to the national grid, which is a network that delivers electricity from producers to consumers. There are also plans for power lines to be built.</p>
<h1 id="early-power-generation-and-other-details">Early Power Generation and Other Details <a href="#early-power-generation-and-other-details" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Two of the turbines started working in 2022, delivering electricity to the national grid. There are also two &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets at the dam that can deliver water to Sudan and Egypt if needed. These outlets can also be used during the initial filling process of the reservoir. The space below the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets is the primary buffer space for alluvium through siltation and sedimentation, which is when water or wind carries small particles of rock and dirt and deposits them somewhere else.</p>

<h1 id="the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-1">The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam <a href="#the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><h2 id="what-is-the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam">What is the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam? <a href="#what-is-the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, also known as GERD, is a big dam being built in Ethiopia. It&rsquo;s so big that when it&rsquo;s finished, it will be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa. That means it will be able to make the most electricity out of all the power plants in Africa that use water to make electricity. It&rsquo;s being built on the Blue Nile River, which is one of the main rivers in Africa.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-the-dam-being-built">Where is the dam being built? <a href="#where-is-the-dam-being-built" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam is being built in a place in Ethiopia called the Benishangul-Gumuz Region. This place is about 45 kilometers (or 28 miles) away from the border with Sudan, another country in Africa. The dam has been under construction since 2011.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-the-dam-being-built">Why is the dam being built? <a href="#why-is-the-dam-being-built" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The main reason the dam is being built is to make electricity. Ethiopia, the country where the dam is being built, doesn&rsquo;t have enough electricity for everyone who lives there. The dam will help solve this problem by making a lot of electricity. The dam will also be able to sell some of its electricity to other countries nearby.</p>
<h2 id="how-big-will-the-dam-be">How big will the dam be? <a href="#how-big-will-the-dam-be" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam will be able to make 5.15 gigawatts of electricity. That&rsquo;s a lot of electricity! In fact, it&rsquo;s so much that it will be one of the 20 largest power plants in the entire world.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-the-dam-being-filled-with-water">How is the dam being filled with water? <a href="#how-is-the-dam-being-filled-with-water" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam is being filled with water in stages. The first stage started in July 2020. By August 2020, the water level in the dam had increased to 540 meters. That&rsquo;s 40 meters higher than the bottom of the river, which is 500 meters above sea level. The second stage of filling was completed on 19 July 2021, when the water level increased to around 575 meters. The third stage was completed on 12 August 2022, when the water level reached 600 meters. As of November 2022, the water level is around 605 meters. It will take between 4 and 7 years to fill the dam with water.</p>
<h2 id="when-did-the-dam-start-making-electricity">When did the dam start making electricity? <a href="#when-did-the-dam-start-making-electricity" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam started making electricity for the first time on 20 February 2022. It was able to deliver electricity to the grid at a rate of 375 MW. A second turbine, which is a machine that helps make electricity, was started in August 2022. This second turbine can also make 375 MW of electricity.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-history-of-the-dam">What is the history of the dam? <a href="#what-is-the-history-of-the-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The place where the dam is being built was first identified by the United States Bureau of Reclamation between 1956 and 1964. However, due to a change in government and a civil war in Ethiopia, the project did not move forward. The Ethiopian Government surveyed the site in October 2009 and August 2010. In November 2010, a design for the dam was submitted by James Kelston. On 31 March 2011, a contract was awarded to an Italian company called Salini Impregilo to build the dam. The foundation stone of the dam was laid on 2 April 2011 by the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-controversies-about-the-dam">What are some controversies about the dam? <a href="#what-are-some-controversies-about-the-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam has caused a lot of controversy in the region. Egypt, a country located downstream of the dam, opposes the dam. Egypt is worried that the dam will reduce the amount of water available from the Nile River. The Nile River is very important to Egypt because it provides about 97% of its irrigation and drinking water. Ethiopia, on the other hand, argues that the dam will not reduce water availability downstream and will also regulate water for irrigation.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-the-dam-cost-and-how-is-it-being-paid-for">How much does the dam cost and how is it being paid for? <a href="#how-much-does-the-dam-cost-and-how-is-it-being-paid-for" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam is estimated to cost close to 5 billion US dollars. This is about 7% of the money that Ethiopia made in 2016. Because of Egypt&rsquo;s opposition to the dam, Ethiopia has had to pay for the dam itself. It has done this through selling bonds and asking employees to contribute a portion of their incomes. The Exim Bank of China has also funded 1 billion US dollars for turbines and electrical equipment.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-design-of-the-dam">What is the design of the dam? <a href="#what-is-the-design-of-the-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The design of the dam has changed several times between 2011 and 2019. This has affected both the electrical parameters and the storage parameters. The dam will have two dams, three spillways, and will be able to generate and distribute power. The dam will also have a system for early power generation and a system for dealing with siltation and evaporation.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-dams">What are the dams? <a href="#what-are-the-dams" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The main dam will be 145 meters tall and 1,780 meters long. It will be made of roller-compacted concrete. The second dam, called the saddle dam, will be 50 meters high and 4.9 kilometers long. The reservoir behind both dams will have a storage capacity of 74 cubic kilometers.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-spillways">What are the spillways? <a href="#what-are-the-spillways" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dams will have three spillways. These are structures that allow water to flow out of the dam. The main spillway will be controlled by six floodgates and have a design discharge of 14,700 cubic meters per second. The second spillway, called the auxiliary spillway, sits at the center of the main dam. The third spillway, called the emergency spillway, is located to the right of the saddle dam.</p>
<h2 id="how-will-the-dam-generate-and-distribute-power">How will the dam generate and distribute power? <a href="#how-will-the-dam-generate-and-distribute-power" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam will be equipped with 2 x 375 MW Francis turbine-generators and 11 x 400 MW turbines. The total installed capacity with all turbine-generators will be 5,150 MW. The average annual flow of the Blue Nile being available for power generation is expected to be 1,547 cubic meters per second. This gives rise to an annual expectation for power generation of 16,153 GWh.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-early-power-generation">What is early power generation? <a href="#what-is-early-power-generation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Two non-upgraded turbine-generators with 375 MW were first to go into operation with 750 MW delivered to the national power grid. The first turbine was commissioned in February 2022 and the second one in August 2022.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-siltation-and-evaporation">What is siltation and evaporation? <a href="#what-is-siltation-and-evaporation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Siltation is when dirt and other particles in the water settle at the bottom of the dam. Evaporation is when water turns into vapor and disappears into the air. The dam has two &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets that are available for delivering water to Sudan and Egypt under special circumstances. These outlets can also be used during the initial filling process of the reservoir.</p>

<h1 id="the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-gerd">The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) <a href="#the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-gerd" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), formerly known as the Millennium Dam, is a gravity dam on the Blue Nile River in Ethiopia. It has been under construction since 2011 and is located in the Benishangul-Gumuz Region of Ethiopia, about 45 km (28 mi) east of the border with Sudan. The primary purpose of the dam is to produce electricity to help Ethiopia&rsquo;s severe energy shortage and to export electricity to neighboring countries. Once completed, the dam will have a planned installed capacity of 5.15 gigawatts, making it the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa and one of the 20 largest in the world.</p>
<p>The dam&rsquo;s reservoir started filling in July 2020, and by August 2020, the water level had increased to 540 meters, 40 meters higher than the bottom of the river. The second phase of filling was completed in July 2021, raising the water level to around 575 meters. The third filling was completed in August 2022 to a level of 600 meters (2,000 ft), 25 m (82 ft) higher than the prior year&rsquo;s second fill. The dam started producing electricity for the first time on 20 February 2022, delivering it to the grid at a rate of 375 MW. A second 375 MW turbine was commissioned in August 2022.</p>
<p>The dam&rsquo;s construction and potential impacts have been a source of regional controversy. Egypt, a country which depends on the Nile for about 97% of its irrigation and drinking water, has demanded that Ethiopia cease construction on the dam as a precondition to negotiations. Ethiopia, however, denies that the dam will have a negative impact on downstream water flows and contends that the dam will, in fact, increase water flows to Egypt by reducing evaporation on Lake Nasser.</p>
<h1 id="cost-and-financing">Cost and Financing <a href="#cost-and-financing" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The GERD is estimated to cost close to 5 billion US dollars, about 7% of the 2016 Ethiopian gross national product. Due to Egypt&rsquo;s campaign to keep control on the Nile water share, Ethiopia has been forced to finance the GERD through crowdfunding, internal fundraising, selling bonds, and persuading employees to contribute a portion of their incomes. Of the total cost, 1 billion US dollars for turbines and electrical equipment were funded by the Exim Bank of China.</p>
<h1 id="design-and-power-generation">Design and Power Generation <a href="#design-and-power-generation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The dam&rsquo;s design has changed several times between 2011 and 2019. Initially, in 2011, the hydropower plant was to receive 15 generating units with 350 MW nameplate capacity each, resulting in a total installed capacity of 5,250 MW. However, the design was later changed to add another 450 MW for a total of 6,450 MW. The dam&rsquo;s storage parameters also changed over time. Originally, in 2011, the dam was planned to be 145 m (476 ft) tall with a volume of 10.1 million m¬≥. However, after the Independent Panel of Experts (IPoE) made its recommendations in 2013, the dam parameters were changed to account for higher flow volumes in case of extreme floods.</p>
<p>The dam will have two power houses, equipped with 2 x 375 MW Francis turbine-generators and 11 x 400 MW turbines. The total installed capacity with all turbine-generators will be 5,150 MW. The average annual flow of the Blue Nile being available for power generation is expected to be 1,547 m3/s (54,600 cu ft/s), which gives rise to an annual expectation for power generation of 16,153 GWh.</p>

The dam was previously referred to as the Millennium Dam and sometimes as the Hidase Dam. A gravity dam is a type of dam that uses its own weight to resist the force of water. The dam has been under construction since 2011.</p>
<h2 id="location-and-purpose">Location and Purpose <a href="#location-and-purpose" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The dam is located in the Benishangul-Gumuz Region of Ethiopia, approximately 45 kilometers (or 28 miles) east of the border with Sudan.

<p>With a planned installed capacity of 5.15 gigawatts, the dam will become the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa once completed. In terms of global ranking, it will be among the top 20 largest. To give you an idea, one gigawatt is equivalent to one billion watts, which is enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes.</p>

<p>On 20 February 2022, the dam produced electricity for the first time, delivering it to the grid at a rate of 375 MW. A second 375 MW turbine was commissioned in August 2022.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background <a href="#background" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Blue Nile river in Ethiopia is known as &ldquo;Abay&rdquo;, a word derived from the Ge&rsquo;ez language meaning &lsquo;great&rsquo; to imply its being &rsquo;the river of rivers&rsquo;. The eventual site for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam was identified by the United States Bureau of Reclamation during the Blue Nile survey, which was conducted between 1956 and 1964 during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. However, due to political instability and the Ethiopian Civil War, the project did not progress.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian Government surveyed the site in October 2009 and August 2010. In November 2010, a design for the dam was submitted by James Kelston. On 31 March 2011, a day after the project was made public, a $4.8 billion contract was awarded without competitive bidding to Italian company Salini Impregilo, and the dam&rsquo;s foundation stone was laid on 2 April 2011 by the Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.</p>
<p>Egypt, located over 2,500 kilometers downstream of the site, opposes the dam, which it believes will reduce the amount of water available from the Nile. However, Zenawi argued, based on an unnamed study, that the dam would not reduce water availability downstream and would also regulate water for irrigation.</p>
<p>The dam was originally called &ldquo;Project X&rdquo;, and after its contract was announced it was called the Millennium Dam. On 15 April 2011, the Council of Ministers renamed it Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.</p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy <a href="#controversy" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The potential impacts of the dam have been the source of severe regional controversy.

<p>The dam will have two main structures: the main gravity dam and a rock-fill saddle dam. The main dam will be 145 m tall, 1,780 m long and composed of roller-compacted concrete. The saddle dam will be 4.9 km long and 50 m high. The reservoir behind both dams will have a storage capacity of 74 km3 and a surface area of 1,874 km2 when at full supply level of 640 m above sea level.</p>
<p>The dams will have three spillways designed for a flood of up to 38,500 m3/s, an event not considered to happen at all, as this discharge volume is the so-called &lsquo;Probable Maximum Flood&rsquo;. All waters from the three spillways are designed to discharge into the Blue Nile before the river enters Sudanese territory.</p>
<p>The dam will be equipped with 2 x 375 MW Francis turbine-generators and 11 x 400 MW turbines, giving a total installed capacity of 5,150 MW.

<h2 id="construction-and-filling-of-the-dam">Construction and Filling of the Dam <a href="#construction-and-filling-of-the-dam" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The first phase of filling the dam&rsquo;s reservoir began in July 2020, and by August 2020, the water level had risen to 540 meters, which is 40 meters higher than the bottom of the river, which sits at 500 meters above sea level. The second phase of filling was completed on 19 July 2021, with the water level rising to around 575 meters. The third filling was completed on 12 August 2022, reaching a level of 600 meters (2,000 ft), 25 m (82 ft) higher than the previous year&rsquo;s second fill. The actual water level as of November 2022 is around 605 meters. It is estimated that it will take between 4 and 7 years to fill the dam with water, depending on hydrologic conditions during the filling period.</p>
<p>On 20 February 2022, the dam produced electricity for the first time, delivering it to the grid at a rate of 375 MW. A second 375 MW turbine was commissioned in August 2022.</p>
<h2 id="background-1">Background <a href="#background-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Blue Nile river, known as &ldquo;Abay&rdquo; in Ethiopia, is derived from the Ge&rsquo;ez word for &lsquo;great&rsquo;, signifying its importance as &rsquo;the river of rivers&rsquo;. The eventual site for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam was identified by the United States Bureau of Reclamation during the Blue Nile survey conducted between 1956 and 1964 during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. However, due to the coup d&rsquo;√©tat of 1974 and the subsequent 17-year-long Ethiopian Civil War, the project did not progress. The Ethiopian Government surveyed the site in October 2009 and August 2010, and in November 2010, a design for the dam was submitted by James Kelston.</p>
<p>On 31 March 2011, a day after the project was made public, a US$4.8 billion contract was awarded without competitive bidding to Italian company Salini Impregilo, and the dam&rsquo;s foundation stone was laid on 2 April 2011 by the Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. A rock-crushing plant was constructed, along with a small air strip for fast transportation. The expectation was for the first two power-generation turbines to become operational after 44 months of construction, or early 2015.</p>
<h2 id="regional-controversy">Regional Controversy <a href="#regional-controversy" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The potential impacts of the dam have been the source of severe regional controversy. Egypt, located over 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) downstream of the site, opposes the dam, which it believes will reduce the amount of water available from the Nile. Zenawi argued, based on an unnamed study, that the dam would not reduce water availability downstream and would also regulate water for irrigation. In May 2011, it was announced that Ethiopia would share blueprints for the dam with Egypt so that the downstream impact could be examined.</p>
<p>The dam was originally called &ldquo;Project X&rdquo;, and after its contract was announced it was called the Millennium Dam. On 15 April 2011, the Council of Ministers renamed it Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Ethiopia has a potential for about 45 GW of hydropower. The dam is being funded by government bonds and private donations. It was slated for completion in July 2017.</p>
<p>Egypt has demanded that Ethiopia cease construction on the dam as a precondition to negotiations, has sought regional support for its position, and some political leaders have discussed methods to sabotage it. Egypt has planned a diplomatic initiative to undermine support for the dam in the region as well as in other countries supporting the project such as China and Italy. However, other nations in the Nile Basin Initiative have expressed support for the dam, including Sudan, the only other nation downstream of the Blue Nile, although Sudan&rsquo;s position towards the dam has varied over time. In 2014, Sudan accused Egypt of inflaming the situation.</p>
<p>Ethiopia denies that the dam will have a negative impact on downstream water flows and contends that the dam will, in fact, increase water flows to Egypt by reducing evaporation on Lake Nasser. Ethiopia has accused Egypt of being unreasonable; In October 2019, Egypt stated that talks with Sudan and Ethiopia over the operation of a $4 billion hydropower dam that Ethiopia is building on the Nile have reached a deadlock. Beginning in November 2019, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin began facilitating negotiations between the three countries.</p>
<h2 id="cost-and-financing-2">Cost and Financing <a href="#cost-and-financing-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is estimated to cost close to 5 billion US dollars, about 7% of the 2016 Ethiopian gross national product. The lack of international financing for projects on the Blue Nile River has persistently been attributed to Egypt&rsquo;s campaign to keep control on the Nile water share. Ethiopia has been forced to finance the GERD with crowd funding through internal fund raising in the form of selling bonds and persuading employees to contribute a portion of their incomes. Contributions are made in the newly official website confirmed by the verified account of the Office of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia. Of the total cost, 1 billion US dollars for turbines and electrical equipment were funded by the Exim Bank of China.</p>
<h2 id="design-1">Design <a href="#design-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The design of the dam changed several times between 2011 and 2019, affecting both the electrical parameters and the storage parameters. Originally, in 2011, the hydropower plant was to receive 15 generating units with 350 MW nameplate capacity each, resulting in a total installed capacity of 5,250 MW with an expected power generation of 15,128 GWh per year. Its planned generation capacity was later increased to 6,000 MW, through 16 generating units with 375 MW nominal capacity each. The expected power generation was estimated at 15,692 GWh per year. In 2017, the design was again changed to add another 450 MW for a total of 6,450 MW, with a planned power generation of 16,153 GWh per year.</p>
<p>Not only the electrical power parameters changed over time, but also the storage parameters. Originally, in 2011, the dam was planned to be 145 m (476 ft) tall with a volume of 10.1 million m¬≥. The reservoir was planned to have a volume of 66 km3 (54,000,000 acre‚ãÖft) and a surface area of 1,680 km2 (650 sq mi) at full supply level. The rock-filled saddle dam beside the main dam was planned to have a height of 45 m (148 ft) meters, a length of 4,800 m (15,700 ft) and a volume of 15 million m¬≥.</p>
<p>In 2013, an Independent Panel of Experts (IPoE) assessed the dam and its technological parameters. At that time, the reservoir sizes were changed already. The size of the reservoir at full supply level went up to 1,874 km2 (724 sq mi), an increase of 194 km2 (75 sq mi). The storage volume at full supply level had increased to 74 km3 (60,000,000 acre‚ãÖft), an increase of 7 km3 (1.7 cu mi). These numbers did not change after 2013. The storage volume of 74 km3 (60,000,000 acre‚ãÖft) is representing nearly entire 84 km3 (68,000,000 acre‚ãÖft) annual flow of Nile.</p>
<p>After the IPoE made its recommendations, in 2013, the dam parameters were changed to account for higher flow volumes in case of extreme floods: a main dam height of 155 m (509 ft), an increase of 10 m (33 ft), with a length of 1,780 m (5,840 ft) (no change) and a dam volume of 10.2 million cubic metres (360√ó10^6 cu ft), an increase of 100,000 m3 (3,500,000 cu ft). The outlet parameters did not change, only the crest of the main dam was raised. The rock saddle dam went up to a height of 50 m (160 ft), an increase of 5 metres (16 ft), with a length of 5,200 m (17,100 ft), an increase of 400 metres (1,300 ft). The volume of the rock saddle dam increased to 16.5 million cubic metres (580√ó10^6 cu ft), an increase of 1.5 million cubic metres (53√ó10^6 cu ft).</p>
<p>The design parameters as of August 2017 are as follows, given the changes as outlined above.</p>
<h3 id="two-dams">Two Dams <a href="#two-dams" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The zero level of the main dam, the ground level, will be at a height of about 500 m (1,600 ft) above sea level, corresponding roughly to the level of the river bed of the Blue Nile. Counting from the ground level, the main gravity dam will be 145 m (476 ft) tall, 1,780 m (5,840 ft) long and composed of roller-compacted concrete. The crest of the dam will be at a height of 655 m (2,149 ft) above sea level. The outlets of the two powerhouses are below the ground level, the total height of the dam will, therefore, be slightly higher than that of the given height of the dam. In some publications, the main contractor constructing the dam puts forward a number of 170 m (560 ft) for the dam height, which might account for the additional depth of the dam below ground level, which would mean 15 m (49 ft) of excavations from the basement before filling the reservoir. The structural volume of the dam will be 10,200,000 m3 (13,300,000 cu yd). The main dam will be 40 km (25 mi) from the border with Sudan.</p>
<p>Supporting the main dam and reservoir will be a curved and 4.9 km (3 mi) long and 50 m (164 ft) high rock-fill saddle dam. The ground level of the saddle dam is at an elevation of about 600 m (2,000 ft) above sea level. The surface of the saddle dam has a bituminous finish, to keep the interior of the dam dry. The saddle dam will be just 3.3‚Äì3.5 km (2‚Äì2 mi) away from the border with Sudan, it is much closer to the border than the main dam.</p>
<p>The reservoir behind both dams will have a storage capacity of 74 km3 (60,000,000 acre‚ãÖft) and a surface area of 1,874 km2 (724 sq mi) when at full supply level of 640 m (2,100 ft) above sea level  The full supply level is therefore 140 m (460 ft) above the ground level of the main dam. Hydropower generation can happen between reservoir levels of 590 m (1,940 ft), the so-called minimum operating level, and 640 m (2,100 ft), the full supply level. The live storage volume, usable for power generation between both levels is then 59.2 km3 (48,000,000 acre‚ãÖft). The first 90 m (300 ft) of the height of the dam will be a dead height for the reservoir, leading to a dead storage volume of the reservoir of 14.8 km3 (12,000,000 acre‚ãÖft).</p>
<h3 id="three-spillways">Three Spillways <a href="#three-spillways" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The dams will have three spillways. All (each?) using approximately 18,000 cubic meters of concrete. These spillways together are designed for a flood of up to 38,500 m3/s (1,360,000 cu ft/s), an event not considered to happen at all, as this discharge volume is the so-called &lsquo;Probable Maximum Flood&rsquo;. All waters from the three spillways are designed to discharge into the Blue Nile before the river enters Sudanese territory.</p>
<p>The main and gated spillway is located to the left of the main dam and will be controlled by six floodgates and have a design discharge of 14,700 m3/s (520,000 cu ft/s) in total. The spillway will be 84 m (276 ft) wide at the outflow gates. The base level of the spillway will be at 624.9 m (2,050 ft), well below the full supply level.</p>
<p>An ungated spillway, the auxiliary spillway, sits at the center of the main dam with an open width of about 205 m (673 ft). This spillway has a base-level at 640 m (2,100 ft), which is exactly the full supply level of the reservoir. The dam crest is 15 m (49 ft) higher to the left and to the right of the spillway. This ungated spillway is only expected to be used, if the reservoir is both full and the flow exceeds 14,700 m3/s (520,000 cu ft/s), a flow value, that is expected to be exceeded once every ten years.</p>
<p>A third spillway, an emergency spillway, is located to the right of the curved saddle dam, with a base level at 642 m (2,106 ft). This emergency spillway has an open space of about 1,200 m (3,900 ft) along its rim. This third spillway will carry water only if the conditions for a flood of more than around 30,000 m3/s (1,100,000 cu ft/s) are given, corresponding to a flood to occur only once every 10,000 years.</p>
<h3 id="power-generation-and-distribution">Power Generation and Distribution <a href="#power-generation-and-distribution" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Flanking either side of the auxiliary ungated spillway at the center of the dam will be two power houses, that will be equipped with 2 x 375 MW Francis turbine-generators and 11 x 400 MW turbines. The total installed capacity with all turbine-generators will be 5,150 MW. The average annual flow of the Blue Nile being available for power generation is expected to be 1,547 m3/s (54,600 cu ft/s), which gives rise to an annual expectation for power generation of 16,153 GWh, corresponding to a plant load factor (or capacity factor) of 28.6%.</p>
<p>The Francis turbines inside the power houses are installed in a vertical manner, raising 7 m (23 ft) above the ground level. For the foreseen operation between the minimum operating level and the full supply level, the water head available to the turbines will be 83‚Äì133 m (272‚Äì436 ft) high. A switching station will be located close to the main dam, where the generated power will be delivered to the national grid. Four 500 kV main power transmission lines were completed in August 2017, all going to Holeta and then with several 400 kV lines to the metropolitan area of Addis Ababa. Two 400 kV lines run from the dam to the Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant. Also planned are 500 kV high-voltage direct current lines.</p>
<h3 id="early-power-generation">Early Power Generation <a href="#early-power-generation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Two non-upgraded turbine-generators with 375 MW were first to go into operation with 750 MW delivered to the national power grid, while the first turbine  was commissioned in February 2022 and the second one in August 2022. The two units sit within the 10 unit powerhouse to the right side of the dam at the auxiliary spillway. They are fed by two special intakes within the dam structure that are located at a height of 540 m (1,770 ft) above sea level. That power generation started at a water level of 560 m (1,840 ft), 30 m (98 ft) below the minimum operating level of the other 11 turbine-generators. At that level, the reservoir has been filled with roughly 5.5 km3 (1.3 cu mi) of water, which corresponds to roughly 11% of the annual inflow of 48.8 km3 (11.7 cu mi). During the rainy season, this is expected to happen within days to weeks. The first stage filling of the reservoir for early generation was completed on 20 July 2020.</p>
<h3 id="siltation-evaporation">Siltation, Evaporation <a href="#siltation-evaporation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Two &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets at 542 m (1,778 ft) above sea level or 42 m (138 ft) above the local river bed level are available for delivering water to Sudan and Egypt under special circumstances, in particular for irrigation purposes downstream, if the level of the reservoir falls below the minimum operating level of 590 m (1,940 ft) but also during the initial filling process of the reservoir.</p>
<p>The space below the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets is the primary buffer space for alluvium through siltation and sedimentation. For the Roseires Reservoir just downstream from the GERD site, the average siltation and sedimentation volume (without GERD in place) amounts to around 0.035 km3 (28,000 acre‚ãÖft) per year. Due to the large size of the GERD reservoir, the average siltation and sedimentation volume is expected to be much lower.</p>

<p>The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, currently under construction on the Blue Nile River, is set to be Africa&rsquo;s largest hydroelectric power plant. The dam&rsquo;s primary purpose is to alleviate Ethiopia&rsquo;s energy shortage and export electricity to neighboring countries. Despite opposition from Egypt, which relies heavily on the Nile for water, Ethiopia maintains that the dam will not reduce downstream water availability and will actually increase water flows to Egypt. The dam has undergone several design changes, and its current power generation capacity is 5,150 MW. The dam began producing electricity for the first time in February 2022.</p>

These numbers did not change after 2013. The storage volume of 74 km3 is representing nearly entire 84 km3 annual flow of Nile.</p>
<p>After the IPoE made its recommendations, in 2013, the dam parameters were changed to account for higher flow volumes in case of extreme floods: a main dam height of 155 m, an increase of 10 m, with a length of 1,780 m (no change) and a dam volume of 10.2 million cubic metres, an increase of 100,000 m3. The outlet parameters did not change, only the crest of the main dam was raised. The rock saddle dam went up to a height of 50 m, an increase of 5 metres, with a length of 5,200 m, an increase of 400 metres. The volume of the rock saddle dam increased to 16.5 million cubic metres, an increase of 1.5 million cubic metres.</p>
<p>The design parameters as of August 2017 are as follows, given the changes as outlined above:</p>
<h3 id="two-dams-1">Two Dams <a href="#two-dams-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The zero level of the main dam, the ground level, will be at a height of about 500 m above sea level, corresponding roughly to the level of the river bed of the Blue Nile. Counting from the ground level, the main gravity dam will be 145 m tall, 1,780 m long and composed of roller-compacted concrete. The crest of the dam will be at a height of 655 m above sea level. The outlets of the two powerhouses are below the ground level, the total height of the dam will, therefore, be slightly higher than that of the given height of the dam. In some publications, the main contractor constructing the dam puts forward a number of 170 m for the dam height, which might account for the additional depth of the dam below ground level, which would mean 15 m of excavations from the basement before filling the reservoir. The structural volume of the dam will be 10,200,000 m3. The main dam will be 40 km from the border with Sudan.</p>
<p>Supporting the main dam and reservoir will be a curved and 4.9 km long and 50 m high rock-fill saddle dam. The ground level of the saddle dam is at an elevation of about 600 m above sea level. The surface of the saddle dam has a bituminous finish, to keep the interior of the dam dry. The saddle dam will be just 3.3‚Äì3.5 km away from the border with Sudan, it is much closer to the border than the main dam.</p>
<p>The reservoir behind both dams will have a storage capacity of 74 km3 and a surface area of 1,874 km2 when at full supply level of 640 m above sea level. The full supply level is therefore 140 m above the ground level of the main dam. Hydropower generation can happen between reservoir levels of 590 m, the so-called minimum operating level, and 640 m, the full supply level. The live storage volume, usable for power generation between both levels is then 59.2 km3. The first 90 m of the height of the dam will be a dead height for the reservoir, leading to a dead storage volume of the reservoir of 14.8 km3.</p>
<h3 id="three-spillways-1">Three Spillways <a href="#three-spillways-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The dams will have three spillways. All (each?) using approximately 18,000 cubic meters of concrete. These spillways together are designed for a flood of up to 38,500 m3/s, an event not considered to happen at all, as this discharge volume is the so-called &lsquo;Probable Maximum Flood&rsquo;. All waters from the three spillways are designed to discharge into the Blue Nile before the river enters Sudanese territory.</p>
<p>The main and gated spillway is located to the left of the main dam and will be controlled by six floodgates and have a design discharge of 14,700 m3/s in total. The spillway will be 84 m wide at the outflow gates. The base level of the spillway will be at 624.9 m, well below the full supply level.</p>
<p>An ungated spillway, the auxiliary spillway, sits at the center of the main dam with an open width of about 205 m. This spillway has a base-level at 640 m, which is exactly the full supply level of the reservoir. The dam crest is 15 m higher to the left and to the right of the spillway. This ungated spillway is only expected to be used, if the reservoir is both full and the flow exceeds 14,700 m3/s, a flow value, that is expected to be exceeded once every ten years.</p>
<p>A third spillway, an emergency spillway, is located to the right of the curved saddle dam, with a base level at 642 m. This emergency spillway has an open space of about 1,200 m along its rim. This third spillway will carry water only if the conditions for a flood of more than around 30,000 m3/s are given, corresponding to a flood to occur only once every 10,000 years.</p>
<h3 id="power-generation-and-distribution-1">Power Generation and Distribution <a href="#power-generation-and-distribution-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Flanking either side of the auxiliary ungated spillway at the center of the dam will be two power houses, that will be equipped with 2 x 375 MW Francis turbine-generators and 11 x 400 MW turbines. The total installed capacity with all turbine-generators will be 5,150 MW. The average annual flow of the Blue Nile being available for power generation is expected to be 1,547 m3/s, which gives rise to an annual expectation for power generation of 16,153 GWh, corresponding to a plant load factor (or capacity factor) of 28.6%.</p>
<p>The Francis turbines inside the power houses are installed in a vertical manner, raising 7 m above the ground level. For the foreseen operation between the minimum operating level and the full supply level, the water head available to the turbines will be 83‚Äì133 m high. A switching station will be located close to the main dam, where the generated power will be delivered to the national grid. Four 500 kV main power transmission lines were completed in August 2017, all going to Holeta and then with several 400 kV lines to the metropolitan area of Addis Ababa. Two 400 kV lines run from the dam to the Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant. Also planned are 500 kV high-voltage direct current lines.</p>
<h3 id="early-power-generation-1">Early Power Generation <a href="#early-power-generation-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Two non-upgraded turbine-generators with 375 MW were first to go into operation with 750 MW delivered to the national power grid, while the first turbine was commissioned in February 2022 and the second one in August 2022. The two units sit within the 10 unit powerhouse to the right side of the dam at the auxiliary spillway. They are fed by two special intakes within the dam structure that are located at a height of 540 m above sea level. That power generation started at a water level of 560 m, 30 m below the minimum operating level of the other 11 turbine-generators. At that level, the reservoir has been filled with roughly 5.5 km3 of water, which corresponds to roughly 11% of the annual inflow of 48.8 km3. During the rainy season, this is expected to happen within days to weeks. The first stage filling of the reservoir for early generation was completed on 20 July 2020.</p>
<h3 id="siltation-evaporation-1">Siltation, Evaporation <a href="#siltation-evaporation-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Two &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets at 542 m above sea level or 42 m above the local river bed level are available for delivering water to Sudan and Egypt under special circumstances, in particular for irrigation purposes downstream, if the level of the reservoir falls below the minimum operating level of 590 m but also during the initial filling process of the reservoir.</p>
<p>The space below the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; outlets is the primary buffer space for alluvium through siltation and sedimentation. For the Roseires Reservoir just downstream from the GERD site, the average siltation and sedimentation volume (without GERD in place) amounts to around 0.035 km3 per year. Due to the large size of the GERD reservoir, the expected siltation and sedimentation volume will be much less than that.</p>

This ancient city is located in the Vijayanagara district in the east-central part of Karnataka, India. Hampi&rsquo;s history is older than the Vijayanagara Empire itself, as it is mentioned in ancient Hindu texts like the Ramayana and the Puranas. These texts refer to it as &lsquo;Pampa Devi Tirtha Kshetra&rsquo;. Even today, Hampi continues to be an important religious center, housing the Virupaksha Temple, an active Adi Shankara-linked monastery, and various monuments from the old city.</p>
<p>In the 14th century, Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire and was a fortified city. Chronicles from Persian and European travelers, especially the Portuguese, describe Hampi as a prosperous, wealthy, and grand city near the Tungabhadra River, filled with temples, farms, and trading markets. By 1500 CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara was the second-largest city in the world after Beijing, and probably the richest in India at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal. However, the Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultanates, and its capital was conquered, pillaged, and destroyed by sultanate armies in 1565, leaving Hampi in ruins.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location <a href="#location" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Hampi is situated on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the eastern part of central Karnataka, near the state border with Andhra Pradesh. It is 376 kilometers (234 miles) from Bengaluru, and 165 kilometers (103 miles) from Hubli. The closest railway station is in Hosapete (Hospet), 13 kilometers (8.1 miles) away, while the closest airport, Jindal Vijaynagar Airport in Toranagallu, is 32 kilometers (20 miles) away and has connections to Bengaluru. Overnight buses and trains also connect Hampi with Goa and Bengaluru. It is 140 kilometers (87 miles) southeast of the Badami and Aihole archaeological sites.</p>
<h2 id="historical-significance">Historical Significance <a href="#historical-significance" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The name Hampi‚Äîtraditionally known as Pampa-kshetra, Kishkindha-kshetra, or Bhaskara-kshetra‚Äîis derived from Pampa, another name of the goddess Parvati in Hindu theology. According to mythology, Parvati, a reincarnation of Shiva&rsquo;s previous wife, Sati, was determined to marry the ascetic Shiva. Despite her parents&rsquo; discouragement, she pursued her desire. To gain Shiva&rsquo;s attention, Parvati appealed to the gods for help. In response, Indra sent Kamadeva ‚Äî the Hindu god of desire, erotic love, attraction, and affection‚Äîto awake Shiva from meditation. However, Shiva, upon being disturbed, opened his third eye and burned Kama to ashes.</p>
<p>Undeterred, Parvati continued her pursuit of Shiva, living like him and engaging in the same activities‚Äîasceticism, yogin, and tapasya‚Äîawakening him and attracting his interest. Despite Shiva&rsquo;s attempts to discourage her by highlighting his weaknesses and personality problems, Parvati remained resolute. Eventually, Shiva accepted her, and they got married. After their marriage, Kama was brought back to life. According to Sthala Purana, Parvati (Pampa) pursued her ascetic, yogini lifestyle on Hemakuta Hill, now a part of Hampi, to win and bring ascetic Shiva back into householder life. Shiva is also called Pampapati (meaning &ldquo;husband of Pampa&rdquo;). The river near the Hemakuta Hill came to be known as the Pampa river. The Sanskrit word Pampa morphed into the Kannada word Hampa, and the place Parvati pursued Shiva came to be known as Hampe or Hampi.</p>
<p>The site was an early medieval era pilgrimage place known as Pampakshetra. Its fame came from the Kishkindha chapters of the Hindu epic Ramayana, where Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, Sugriva, and the monkey army in their search for kidnapped Sita. The Hampi area has many close resemblances to the place described in the epic. The regional tradition believes that it is that place mentioned in the Ramayana, attracting pilgrims. It was brought to light by an engineer named Colonel Colin Mackenzie during the 1800s.</p>
<h2 id="ancient-to-14th-century-ce">Ancient to 14th century CE <a href="#ancient-to-14th-century-ce" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Emperor Ashoka&rsquo;s Rock Edicts in Nittur and Udegolan‚Äîboth in Bellary district 269-232 BCE‚Äîsuggest this region was part of the Maurya Empire during the 3rd century BCE. A Brahmi inscription and a terracotta seal dating to about the 2nd century CE have been found during site excavations. The town is mentioned in Badami Chalukya&rsquo;s inscriptions as Pampapura, dating from between the 6th and 8th centuries. By the 10th century, it had become a center of religious and educational activities during the rule of the Hindu kings Kalyana Chalukyas, whose inscriptions state that the kings made land grants to the Virupaksha temple. Several inscriptions from the 11th to 13th centuries are about the Hampi site, with a mention of gifts to goddess Hampa-devi. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, Hindu kings of the Hoysala Empire of South India built temples to Durga, Hampadevi, and Shiva, according to an inscription dated about 1,199 CE. Hampi became the second royal residence; one of the Hoysala kings was known as Hampeya-Odeya or &ldquo;lord of Hampi&rdquo;. According to Burton Stein, the Hoysala-period inscriptions call Hampi by alternate names such as Virupakshapattana, Vijaya Virupakshapura in honor of the old Virupaksha (Shiva) temple there.</p>
<h2 id="14th-century-and-after">14th Century and After <a href="#14th-century-and-after" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The armies of the Delhi Sultanate, particularly those of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad bin Tughlaq, invaded and pillaged South India. The Hoysala Empire and its capital Dvarasamudra in southern Karnataka were plundered and destroyed in the early 14th century by the armies of Alauddin Khalji, and again in 1326 CE by the army of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. The Kampili kingdom in north-central Karnataka followed the collapse of Hoysala Empire. It was a short-lived Hindu kingdom with its capital about 33 kilometers (21 mi) from Hampi. The Kampili kingdom ended after an invasion by the Muslim armies of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. The Hindu women of Kampili committed jauhar (ritual mass suicide) when the Kampili soldiers faced defeat by Tughlaq&rsquo;s army. In 1336 CE, the Vijayanagara Empire arose from the ruins of the Kampili kingdom. It grew into one of the famed Hindu empires of South India that ruled for over 200 years.</p>
<p>The Vijayanagara Empire built its capital around Hampi, calling it Vijayanagara. Many historians propose that Harihara I and Bukka I, the founders of the empire, were commanders in the army of the Hoysala Empire stationed in the Tungabhadra region to ward off Muslim invasions from the Northern India. Some claim that they were Telugu people, who took control of the northern parts of the Hoysala Empire during its decline. As per some of the texts such as Vidyaranya Kalajana, Vidyaranya Vritanta, Rajakalanirnaya, Pitamahasamhita, Sivatatvaratnakara, they were treasury officers of Pratap Rudra, the King of Kakatiya Kingdom. When Muhammad Bin Tughlaq came looking for Baha-Ud-Din Gurshasp (who was taking refuge in the court of Pratap Rudra), Pratap Rudra was overthrown and Kakatiya was destroyed. During this time the two brothers Harihara I and Bukka I, with a small army came to the present site of Vijayanagara, Hampi. Vidyaranya, the 12th Jagadguru of the ≈öringeri ≈öarada Pƒ´tham took them under his protection and established them on the throne and the city was called Vidyanagara in A.D. 1336.</p>
<p>They expanded the infrastructure and temples. According to Nicholas Gier and other scholars, by 1500 CE Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world&rsquo;s second-largest medieval-era city after Beijing, and probably India&rsquo;s richest. Its wealth attracted 16th-century traders from across the Deccan area, Persia, and the Portuguese colony of Goa. The Vijayanagara rulers fostered developments in intellectual pursuits and the arts, maintained a strong military, and fought many wars with sultanates to its north and east. They invested in roads, waterworks, agriculture, religious buildings, and public infrastructure. This included, states UNESCO, &ldquo;forts, riverside features, royal and sacred complexes, temples, shrines, pillared halls, mandapas (halls for people to sit), memorial structures, gateways, check posts, stables, water structures, and more&rdquo;. The site was multi-religious and multi-ethnic; it included Hindu and Jain monuments next to each other. The buildings predominantly followed South Indian Hindu arts and architecture dating to the Aihole-Pattadakal styles, but the Hampi builders also used elements of Indian architecture in the Lotus Mahal, the public bath, and the elephant stables.</p>
<p>According to historical memoirs left by Portuguese and Persian traders to Hampi, the city was of metropolitan proportions; they called it &ldquo;one of the most beautiful cities&rdquo;. While prosperous and in infrastructure, the Muslim-Hindu wars between Muslim Sultanates and Vijayanagara Empire continued. In 1565, at the Battle of Talikota, a coalition of Muslim sultanates entered into a war with the Vijayanagara Empire. They captured and beheaded the king Aliya Rama Raya, followed by a massive destruction of the infrastructure fabric of Hampi and the metropolitan Vijayanagara. The city was pillaged, looted, and burnt for six months after the war, then abandoned as ruins, which are now called the Group of Monuments at Hampi.</p>
<h2 id="archaeological-site">Archaeological Site <a href="#archaeological-site" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Hampi and its nearby region remained a contested and fought-over region claimed by the local chiefs, the Hyderabad Muslim nizams, the Maratha Hindu kings, and Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan of Mysore through the 18th century. In 1799, Tipu Sultan was defeated and killed when the British forces and Wadiyar dynasty aligned. The region then came under British influence. The ruins of Hampi were surveyed in 1800 by Scottish Colonel Colin Mackenzie, first Surveyor General of India. Mackenzie wrote that the Hampi site was abandoned and only wildlife live there. The 19th-century speculative articles by historians who followed Mackenzie blamed the 18th-century armies of Hyder Ali and the Marathas for the damage to the Hampi monuments.</p>
<p>The Hampi site remained largely ignored until the mid-19th century when Alexander Greenlaw visited and photographed the site in 1856. He created an archive of 60 calotype photographs of temples and royal structures that were standing in 1856. These photographs were held in a private collection in the United Kingdom and were not published until 1980. They are the most valuable source of the mid-19th-century state of Hampi monuments to scholars. A translation of the memoirs written by Abdul Razzaq, a Persian envoy in the court of Devaraya II (1424‚Äì1446), published in the early 1880s described some monuments of the abandoned site. This translation, for the first time, uses Arabic terms such as &ldquo;zenana&rdquo; to describe some of the Hampi monuments. Some of these terms became the names thereafter. Alexander Rea, an officer of the Archaeological Survey department of the Madras Presidency within British India, published his survey of the site in 1885. Robert Sewell published his scholarly treatise A Forgotten Empire in 1900, bringing Hampi to the widespread attention of scholars. The growing interest led Rea and his successor Longhurst to clear and repair the Hampi group of monuments. The site is significant historically and archaeologically, for the Vijayanagara period and before. The Archaeological Survey of India continues to conduct excavations in the area.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description <a href="#description" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Hampi is located in hilly terrain formed by granite boulders. The Hampi monuments comprising the UNESCO world heritage site are a subset of the wider-spread Vijayanagara ruins. Almost all of the monuments were built between 1336 and 1570 CE during the Vijayanagara rule. The site has about 1,600 monuments and covers 41.5 square kilometers (16.0 sq mi). The Hampi site has been studied in three broad zones; the first has been named the &ldquo;sacred centre&rdquo; by scholars such as Burton Stein and others; the second is referred to as the &ldquo;urban core&rdquo; or the &ldquo;royal centre&rdquo;; and the third constitutes the rest of metropolitan Vijayanagara. The sacred centre, alongside the river, contains the oldest temples with a history of pilgrimage and monuments pre-dating the Vijayanagara empire. The urban core and royal centre have over sixty ruined temples beyond those in the sacred centre, but the temples in the urban core are all dated to the Vijayanagara empire. The urban core also includes public utility infrastructure such as roads, an aqueduct, water tanks, mandapa, gateways and markets, monasteries. This distinction has been assisted by some seventy-seven stone inscriptions. Most of the monuments are Hindu; the temples and the public infrastructure such as tanks and markets include reliefs and artwork depicting Hindu deities and themes from Hindu texts. There are also six Jain temples and monuments and a Muslim mosque and tomb. The architecture is built from the abundant local stone; the dominant style is Dravidian, with roots in the developments in Hindu arts and architecture in the second half of the 1st millennium in the Deccan region. It also included elements of the arts that developed during the Hoysala Empire rule in the south between the 11th and 14th century such as in the pillars of Ramachandra temple and ceilings of some of the Virupaksha temple complex. The architects also adopted an Indo-Islamic style in a few monuments, such as the Queen&rsquo;s bath and Elephant stables, which UNESCO says reflects a &ldquo;highly evolved multi-religious and multi-ethnic society&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="hindu-monuments">Hindu Monuments <a href="#hindu-monuments" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="virupaksha-temple-and-market-complex">Virupaksha Temple and Market Complex <a href="#virupaksha-temple-and-market-complex" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The Virupaksha temple is the oldest shrine, the principal destination for pilgrims and tourists, and remains an active Hindu worship site. Parts of the Shiva, Pampa, and Durga temples existed in the 11th-century; it was extended during the Vijayanagara era. The temple is a collection of smaller temples, a regularly repainted, 50-meter (160 ft) high gopuram, a Hindu monastery dedicated to Vidyaranya of Advaita Vedanta tradition, a water tank (Manmatha), a community kitchen, other monuments and a 750 meters (2,460 ft)-long ruined stone market with a monolithic Nandi shrine on the east end. The temple faces eastwards, aligning the sanctums of the Shiva and Pampa Devi temples to the sunrise; a large gopuram marks its entrance. The superstructure is a pyramidal tower with pilastered storeys on each of which is artwork including erotic sculptures. The gopuram leads into a rectangular court that ends in another, smaller gopuram dated to 1510 CE. To its south side is a 100-column hall with Hindu-related reliefs on all four sides of each pillar. Connected to this public hall is a community kitchen, a feature found in other major Hampi temples. A channel is cut into the rock to deliver water to the kitchen and the feeding hall. The courtyard after the small gopuram has dipa-stambha (lamp pillar) and Nandi. The courtyard after the small gopuram leads to the main mandapa of the Shiva temple, which consists of the original square mandapa and a rectangular extension composed of two fused squares and sixteen piers built by Krishnadevaraya. The ceiling of the open hall above the mandapa is painted, showing the Shaivism legend relating to Shiva-Parvati marriage; another section shows the legend of Rama-Sita of the Vaishnavism tradition. A third section depicts the legend of the love god Kama shooting an arrow at Shiva to get him interested in Parvati, and the fourth section shows the Advaita Hindu scholar Vidyaranya&rsquo;s contribution to the establishment of the Vijayanagara Empire.</p>

<p>The name Hampi is derived from Pampa, another name for the goddess Parvati in Hindu theology. According to mythology, Parvati, desiring to marry the ascetic Shiva, pursued a lifestyle of asceticism and yogic practices on Hemakuta Hill, now part of Hampi, to win over Shiva. The river near Hemakuta Hill came to be known as Pampa river, and the Sanskrit word Pampa evolved into the Kannada word Hampa, giving the place the name Hampi. The site was an early medieval era pilgrimage place known as Pampakshetra, and its fame came from the Kishkindha chapters of the Hindu epic Ramayana.</p>

It is 376 kilometers from Bengaluru, and 165 kilometers from Hubli. The closest railway station is in Hosapete, 13 kilometers away, and the closest airport is Jindal Vijaynagar Airport in Toranagallu, which has connections to Bengaluru. Overnight buses and trains also connect Hampi with Goa and Bengaluru. It is 140 kilometers southeast of the Badami and Aihole archaeological sites.</p>
<p>The name Hampi‚Äîtraditionally known as Pampa-kshetra, Kishkindha-kshetra, or Bhaskara-kshetra‚Äîis derived from Pampa, another name of the goddess Parvati in Hindu theology. According to mythology, the maiden Parvati resolves to marry the loner ascetic Shiva. Her parents learn of her desire and discourage her, but she pursues her desire. Shiva is lost in yogic meditation, oblivious to the world; Parvati appeals to the gods for help to awaken him and gain his attention. Indra sends Kamadeva ‚Äî the Hindu god of desire, erotic love, attraction, and affection‚Äîto awake Shiva from meditation. Kama reaches Shiva and shoots an arrow of desire. Shiva opens his third eye in his forehead and burns Kama to ashes.</p>
<p>Parvati does not lose her hope or her resolve to win over Shiva; she begins to live like him and engage in the same activities‚Äîasceticism, yogin, and tapasya‚Äîawakening him and attracting his interest. Shiva meets Parvati in disguised form and tries to discourage her, telling her Shiva&rsquo;s weaknesses and personality problems. Parvati refuses to listen and insists on her resolve. Shiva finally accepts her and they get married. Kama was later brought back to life after the marriage of Shiva and Parvati. According to Sthala Purana, Parvati (Pampa) pursued her ascetic, yogini lifestyle on Hemakuta Hill, now a part of Hampi, to win and bring ascetic Shiva back into householder life. Shiva is also called Pampapati (meaning &ldquo;husband of Pampa&rdquo;). The river near the Hemakuta Hill came to be known as Pampa river. The Sanskrit word Pampa morphed into the Kannada word Hampa and the place Parvati pursued Shiva came to be known as Hampe or Hampi.</p>

A Brahmi inscription and a terracotta seal dating to about the 2nd century CE have been found during site excavations. The town is mentioned in Badami Chalukya&rsquo;s inscriptions as Pampapura, dating from between the 6th and 8th centuries. By the 10th century, it had become a center of religious and educational activities during the rule of the Hindu kings Kalyana Chalukyas, whose inscriptions state that the kings made land grants to the Virupaksha temple. Several inscriptions from the 11th to 13th centuries are about the Hampi site, with a mention of gifts to goddess Hampa-devi. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, Hindu kings of the Hoysala Empire of South India built temples to Durga, Hampadevi, and Shiva, according to an inscription dated about 1,199 CE. Hampi became the second royal residence; one of the Hoysala kings was known as Hampeya-Odeya or &ldquo;lord of Hampi&rdquo;. According to Burton Stein, the Hoysala-period inscriptions call Hampi by alternate names such as Virupakshapattana, Vijaya Virupakshapura in honor of the old Virupaksha (Shiva) temple there.</p>

The Kampili kingdom in north-central Karnataka followed the collapse of the Hoysala Empire. It was a short-lived Hindu kingdom with its capital about 33 kilometers from Hampi. The Kampili kingdom ended after an invasion by the Muslim armies of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. The Hindu women of Kampili committed jauhar (ritual mass suicide) when the Kampili soldiers faced defeat by Tughlaq&rsquo;s army.

<p>The Vijayanagara Empire built its capital around Hampi, calling it Vijayanagara. Many historians propose that Harihara I and Bukka I, the founders of the empire, were commanders in the army of the Hoysala Empire stationed in the Tungabhadra region to ward off Muslim invasions from Northern India. Some claim that they were Telugu people, who took control of the northern parts of the Hoysala Empire during its decline. As per some of the texts such as Vidyaranya Kalajana, Vidyaranya Vritanta, Rajakalanirnaya, Pitamahasamhita, Sivatatvaratnakara, they were treasury officers of Pratap Rudra, the King of Kakatiya Kingdom. When Muhammad Bin Tughlaq came looking for Baha-Ud-Din Gurshasp (who was taking refuge in the court of Pratap Rudra), Pratap Rudra was overthrown and Kakatiya was destroyed. During this time the two brothers Harihara I and Bukka I, with a small army came to the present site of Vijayanagara, Hampi. Vidyaranya, the 12th Jagadguru of the ≈öringeri ≈öarada Pƒ´tham took them under his protection and established them on the throne and the city was called Vidyanagara in A.D. 1336.</p>
<p>They expanded the infrastructure and temples. According to Nicholas Gier and other scholars, by 1500 CE Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world&rsquo;s second-largest medieval-era city after Beijing, and probably India&rsquo;s richest. Its wealth attracted 16th-century traders from across the Deccan area, Persia, and the Portuguese colony of Goa. The Vijayanagara rulers fostered developments in intellectual pursuits and the arts, maintained a strong military, and fought many wars with sultanates to its north and east. They invested in roads, waterworks, agriculture, religious buildings, and public infrastructure. This included, states UNESCO, &ldquo;forts, riverside features, royal and sacred complexes, temples, shrines, pillared halls, mandapas (halls for people to sit), memorial structures, gateways, check posts, stables, water structures, and more&rdquo;. The site was multi-religious and multi-ethnic; it included Hindu and Jain monuments next to each other. The buildings predominantly followed South Indian Hindu arts and architecture dating to the Aihole-Pattadakal styles, but the Hampi builders also used elements of Indian architecture in the Lotus Mahal, the public bath, and the elephant stables.</p>
<p>According to historical memoirs left by Portuguese and Persian traders to Hampi, the city was of metropolitan proportions; they called it &ldquo;one of the most beautiful cities&rdquo;. While prosperous and in infrastructure, the Muslim-Hindu wars between Muslim Sultanates and Vijayanagara Empire continued. In 1565, at the Battle of Talikota, a coalition of Muslim sultanates entered into a war with the Vijayanagara Empire. They captured and beheaded the king Aliya Rama Raya, followed by a massive destruction of the infrastructure fabric of Hampi and the metropolitan Vijayanagara. The city was pillaged, looted and burnt for six months after the war, then abandoned as ruins, which are now called the Group of Monuments at Hampi.</p>
<h2 id="archaeological-site-2">Archaeological Site <a href="#archaeological-site-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Hampi and its nearby region remained a contested and fought-over region claimed by the local chiefs, the Hyderabad Muslim nizams, the Maratha Hindu kings, and Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan of Mysore through the 18th century. In 1799, Tipu Sultan was defeated and killed when the British forces and Wadiyar dynasty aligned. The region then came under British influence. The ruins of Hampi were surveyed in 1800 by Scottish Colonel Colin Mackenzie, first Surveyor General of India. Mackenzie wrote that the Hampi site was abandoned and only wildlife live there. The 19th-century speculative articles by historians who followed Mackenzie blamed the 18th-century armies of Hyder Ali and the Marathas for the damage to the Hampi monuments.</p>
<p>The Hampi site remained largely ignored until the mid-19th century, when Alexander Greenlaw visited and photographed the site in 1856. He created an archive of 60 calotype photographs of temples and royal structures that were standing in 1856. These photographs were held in a private collection in the United Kingdom and were not published until 1980. They are the most valuable source of the mid-19th-century state of Hampi monuments to scholars. A translation of the memoirs written by Abdul Razzaq, a Persian envoy in the court of Devaraya II (1424‚Äì1446), published in the early 1880s described some monuments of the abandoned site. This translation, for the first time, uses Arabic terms such as &ldquo;zenana&rdquo; to describe some of the Hampi monuments. Some of these terms became the names thereafter. Alexander Rea, an officer of the Archaeological Survey department of the Madras Presidency within British India, published his survey of the site in 1885. Robert Sewell published his scholarly treatise A Forgotten Empire in 1900, bringing Hampi to the widespread attention of scholars. The growing interest led Rea and his successor Longhurst to clear and repair the Hampi group of monuments. The site is significant historically and archaeologically, for the Vijayanagara period and before. The Archaeological Survey of India continues to conduct excavations in the area.</p>
<h2 id="description-2">Description <a href="#description-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Hampi is located in hilly terrain formed by granite boulders. The Hampi monuments comprising the UNESCO world heritage site are a subset of the wider-spread Vijayanagara ruins. Almost all of the monuments were built between 1336 and 1570 CE during the Vijayanagara rule. The site has about 1,600 monuments and covers 41.5 square kilometers.</p>
<p>The Hampi site has been studied in three broad zones; the first has been named the &ldquo;sacred centre&rdquo; by scholars such as Burton Stein and others; the second is referred to as the &ldquo;urban core&rdquo; or the &ldquo;royal centre&rdquo;; and the third constitutes the rest of metropolitan Vijayanagara. The sacred centre, alongside the river, contains the oldest temples with a history of pilgrimage and monuments pre-dating the Vijayanagara empire. The urban core and royal centre have over sixty ruined temples beyond those in the sacred centre, but the temples in the urban core are all dated to the Vijayanagara empire. The urban core also includes public utility infrastructure such as roads, an aqueduct, water tanks, mandapa, gateways, and markets, monasteries. This distinction has been assisted by some seventy-seven stone inscriptions.</p>
<p>Most of the monuments are Hindu; the temples and the public infrastructure such as tanks and markets include reliefs and artwork depicting Hindu deities and themes from Hindu texts. There are also six Jain temples and monuments and a Muslim mosque and tomb. The architecture is built from the abundant local stone; the dominant style is Dravidian, with roots in the developments in Hindu arts and architecture in the second half of the 1st millennium in the Deccan region. It also included elements of the arts that developed during the Hoysala Empire rule in the south between the 11th and 14th century such as in the pillars of Ramachandra temple and ceilings of some of the Virupaksha temple complex. The architects also adopted an Indo-Islamic style in a few monuments, such as the Queen&rsquo;s bath and Elephant stables, which UNESCO says reflects a &ldquo;highly evolved multi-religious and multi-ethnic society&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="hindu-monuments-2">Hindu Monuments <a href="#hindu-monuments-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><h3 id="virupaksha-temple-and-market-complex-2">Virupaksha Temple and Market Complex <a href="#virupaksha-temple-and-market-complex-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The Virupaksha temple is the oldest shrine, the principal destination for pilgrims and tourists, and remains an active Hindu worship site. Parts of the Shiva, Pampa, and Durga temples existed in the 11th-century; it was extended during the Vijayanagara era. The temple is a collection of smaller temples, a regularly repainted, 50-meter high gopuram, a Hindu monastery dedicated to Vidyaranya of Advaita Vedanta tradition, a water tank (Manmatha), a community kitchen, other monuments, and a 750-meter-long ruined stone market with a monolithic Nandi shrine on the east end.</p>
<p>The temple faces eastwards, aligning the sanctums of the Shiva and Pampa Devi temples to the sunrise; a large gopuram marks its entrance. The superstructure is a pyramidal tower with pilastered stories on each of which is artwork including erotic sculptures. The gopuram leads into a rectangular court that ends in another, smaller gopuram dated to 1510 CE. To its south side is a 100-column hall with Hindu-related reliefs on all four sides of each pillar. Connected to this public hall is a community kitchen, a feature found in other major Hampi temples. A channel is cut into the rock to deliver water to the kitchen and the feeding hall. The courtyard after the small gopuram has dipa-stambha (lamp pillar) and Nandi.</p>
<p>The courtyard after the small gopuram leads to the main mandapa of the Shiva temple, which consists of the original square mandapa and a rectangular extension composed of two fused squares and sixteen piers built by Krishnadevaraya. The ceiling of the open hall above the mandapa is painted, showing the Shaivism legend relating to Shiva-Parvati marriage; another section shows the legend of Rama-Sita of the Vaishnavism tradition. A third section depicts the legend of the love god Kama shooting an arrow at Shiva to get him interested in Parvati, and the fourth section shows the Advaita Hindu scholar Vidyaranya.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a disease that damages the protective covering of nerves in the brain and spinal cord. This can cause problems like double vision, muscle weakness, and trouble with balance. Doctors aren&rsquo;t sure what causes MS, but it might be due to the body&rsquo;s defense system attacking the nerves or a problem with the cells that make the nerve covering. It&rsquo;s also possible that genes or things in the environment, like viruses, might play a role. There isn&rsquo;t a cure for MS, but treatments can help manage symptoms and slow down the disease. MS is more common in women and usually starts between the ages of 20 and 50.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-multiple-sclerosis">Understanding Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#understanding-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a disease that harms the protective covers of nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord. Imagine the wires in your house. They are covered by a plastic layer to protect them. If that layer is damaged, the wires might not work properly. The same thing happens in your body when MS damages the protective layer of your nerves. This can cause problems like double vision, muscle weakness, and trouble with coordination. It&rsquo;s like the body&rsquo;s messaging system gets mixed up.</p>
<p>MS can show up in different ways. Sometimes, new symptoms might appear suddenly and then go away, only to come back later. Other times, the symptoms might slowly get worse over time. The cause of MS is not fully understood, but it might have to do with the body&rsquo;s immune system attacking its own cells, or with cells that produce the protective layer failing to do their job properly. Right now, there is no cure for MS, but there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>In 2022, almost one million people in the United States have MS, and it affects more than 2.8 million people around the world. It usually starts between the ages of 20 and 50 and is more common in women than in men. The name &ldquo;multiple sclerosis&rdquo; refers to the many scars that develop on the brain and spinal cord because of the disease.</p>
<h1 id="symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis">Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>People with MS can experience a wide range of symptoms, depending on where the damage in the nervous system occurs. These can include loss of sensitivity, muscle weakness, blurred vision, difficulty moving, problems with coordination and balance, and problems with speech or swallowing. Some people might also feel very tired, have pain, or have trouble with bladder and bowel control. When MS gets worse, walking can become difficult and the risk of falling increases.</p>
<p>Thinking and emotional problems, like depression or mood swings, are also common. Some people might find that their thinking slows down, or that they have trouble remembering things. However, intelligence and language skills are usually not affected. There are some signs that are particularly common in MS, like a worsening of symptoms when the body temperature rises, or an electric shock-like sensation when bending the neck.</p>
<h1 id="causes-of-multiple-sclerosis">Causes of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#causes-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The exact cause of MS is not known, but it&rsquo;s believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. That means that both your genes (the information you inherit from your parents) and things in your environment (like viruses) might play a role. There are many different microbes (tiny organisms like bacteria and viruses) that have been suggested as possible triggers for MS. One idea is that getting infected with a certain microbe early in life might protect you, while getting infected later in life might increase your risk of MS.</p>
<p>There is also a genetic aspect to MS, meaning it can run in families. If one of your parents or siblings has MS, your risk of getting it is higher. Certain genes have been linked to MS, but it&rsquo;s a complex disease that is likely influenced by many different genes. Finally, where you live might also affect your risk of MS. It&rsquo;s more common in people who live farther from the equator, although there are some exceptions. Other factors, like smoking and obesity, might also increase the risk of MS.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-multiple-sclerosis-1">Understanding Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#understanding-multiple-sclerosis-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Multiple sclerosis, often shortened to MS, is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It&rsquo;s like the body&rsquo;s electrical wiring system breaking down. The brain sends messages to the body through nerves, like wires. These nerves are covered by a protective layer called myelin, like the plastic coating around a wire. In MS, the myelin gets damaged, which makes it harder for the brain to send messages to the rest of the body. This can cause a lot of different problems, like feeling weak, having trouble moving, or having problems with seeing.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-in-ms">What Happens in MS? <a href="#what-happens-in-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>In MS, the body&rsquo;s defense system, called the immune system, starts attacking the myelin. It&rsquo;s like if a robot started attacking its own wires. Scientists aren&rsquo;t sure why this happens, but they think it might be because of a mix of genes and things in the environment, like viruses.</p>
<p>MS can show up in different ways. Sometimes, people with MS will have periods where they feel worse, called attacks, and then they&rsquo;ll feel better for a while. Other times, they might feel worse and worse over time. They might also have a mix of these two patterns.</p>
<h2 id="how-common-is-ms">How Common is MS? <a href="#how-common-is-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MS is the most common disease of this type, affecting the central nervous system.

They might also have problems with balance, speaking, or swallowing.</p>
<p>As the disease gets worse, they might have trouble walking and might fall more often. They might also have problems with thinking or feel sad or moody. Some people with MS might feel worse when it&rsquo;s hot or when they bend their neck.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Inflammation</strong>: This is when the body&rsquo;s defense system attacks the myelin. It&rsquo;s like if a robot started attacking its own wires. This causes swelling and more damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Destruction of myelin</strong>: This is when the protective layer around the nerves gets damaged or destroyed. It&rsquo;s like if the plastic coating around a wire got stripped away.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="lesions">Lesions <a href="#lesions" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The name &ldquo;multiple sclerosis&rdquo; comes from the many scars, or lesions, that form in the nervous system. These lesions mostly affect the white matter in the brain and spinal cord. The white matter is like the body&rsquo;s electrical wiring system. It carries messages between the brain, where the thinking happens, and the rest of the body.</p>
<p>When the myelin is damaged, the nerves can&rsquo;t carry messages as well. The body tries to fix the myelin, but it can&rsquo;t completely rebuild it. Over time, the nerves themselves might also get damaged.</p>
<h2 id="inflammation">Inflammation <a href="#inflammation" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Inflammation is another sign of MS. This is when the body&rsquo;s defense system, the immune system, attacks the myelin. This starts a chain reaction that leads to more damage.</p>
<h2 id="blood-brain-barrier">Blood-Brain Barrier <a href="#blood-brain-barrier" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The blood-brain barrier is like a gate that keeps things out of the brain. In MS, this gate might get broken, letting things into the brain that shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>

<h1 id="multiple-sclerosis-an-overview">Multiple Sclerosis: An Overview <a href="#multiple-sclerosis-an-overview" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting the nervous system&rsquo;s ability to transmit signals. This can result in a variety of symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. For instance, someone with MS might experience double vision, muscle weakness, or trouble with sensation or coordination. The disease can take several forms, with symptoms either appearing in isolated attacks or gradually building up over time. The exact cause of MS is unclear, but it&rsquo;s thought to be related to the immune system or a failure of the cells that produce myelin, the insulating cover of nerve cells. Factors like genetics and environmental factors, such as viral infections, could also play a role. As of now, there is no known cure for MS, but treatments can help improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks.</p>
<p>MS is the most common immune-mediated disorder affecting the central nervous system. In 2022, nearly one million people in the United States have MS, and in 2020, about 2.8 million people were affected globally. The disease usually begins between the ages of 20 and 50 and is twice as common in women as in men. French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot first described MS in 1868. The term &ldquo;multiple sclerosis&rdquo; refers to the multiple glial scars (or plaques or lesions) that develop on the white matter of the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<h2 id="symptoms-and-diagnosis">Symptoms and Diagnosis <a href="#symptoms-and-diagnosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The symptoms of MS can vary greatly and depend on the locations of the lesions within the nervous system. These can include loss of sensitivity, muscle weakness, blurred vision, difficulty moving, and problems with coordination and balance. Cognitive difficulties and emotional problems are also common. There are two main patterns of symptom occurrence: episodes of sudden worsening followed by improvement, or a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery. MS is usually diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests.</p>
<h2 id="causes-and-risk-factors">Causes and Risk Factors <a href="#causes-and-risk-factors" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>While the exact cause of MS is unknown, it&rsquo;s believed to be a result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS. For example, the Epstein-Barr herpes virus (EBV), which infects about 95% of adults, has been linked to MS. Genetics also play a significant role in MS. The disease is not considered a Mendelian disease, meaning it&rsquo;s not caused by a single gene, but rather multiple genetic variations that increase the risk. Other risk factors include smoking, stress, and obesity during adolescence and young adulthood.</p>

This damage interrupts the nervous system&rsquo;s ability to transmit signals, leading to various physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. The symptoms can include double vision, loss of vision, muscle weakness, and issues with sensation or coordination.</p>
<p>MS can take several forms, with new symptoms either appearing in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or gradually building up over time (progressive forms). In the relapsing forms of MS, symptoms may completely disappear between attacks, but some permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease progresses.</p>
<p>The cause of MS is still unclear, but it&rsquo;s believed to be due to the destruction by the immune system or failure of the cells that produce myelin, the insulating cover of nerve cells. Genetics and environmental factors, such as viral infections, are proposed causes. MS is usually diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms presented and the results of supporting medical tests.</p>
<h2 id="signs-and-symptoms">Signs and Symptoms <a href="#signs-and-symptoms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>A person with MS can experience almost any neurological symptom. The specific symptoms depend on the locations of the lesions (damaged areas) within the nervous system. These symptoms may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, such as tingling, pins and needles, or numbness; muscle weakness, blurred vision, pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination and balance; problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems, feeling tired, acute or chronic pain; and bladder and bowel difficulties.</p>
<p>When MS advances, walking difficulties can occur, and the risk of falling increases. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. The primary deficit in cognitive function that people with MS experience is slowed information-processing speed, with memory also commonly affected.</p>
<h3 id="prodromal-phase">Prodromal Phase <a href="#prodromal-phase" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>MS may have a prodromal phase in the years leading up to its manifestation, characterized by psychiatric issues, cognitive impairment, and increased use of healthcare.</p>
<h2 id="causes">Causes <a href="#causes" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The cause of MS is unknown, but it&rsquo;s believed to occur as a result of some combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as infectious agents.</p>
<h3 id="infectious-agents">Infectious Agents <a href="#infectious-agents" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS. One hypothesis is that infection by a widespread microbe contributes to disease development, and the geographic distribution of this organism influences the epidemiology of MS. Epstein-Barr herpes virus (EBV), which can cause infectious mononucleosis and infects about 95% of adults, has been linked to MS.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that damages the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting the nervous system&rsquo;s ability to transmit signals. This can result in physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric symptoms, such as double vision, muscle weakness, and coordination issues. MS can progress in different ways, with symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks or building up over time. The cause is unclear but is thought to involve the immune system or failure of myelin-producing cells. There is no known cure for MS, but treatments aim to improve function and prevent new attacks. Nearly one million people have MS in the United States in 2022, and about 2.8 million people were affected globally in 2020.</p>

<h1 id="multiple-sclerosis-an-overview-1">Multiple Sclerosis: An Overview <a href="#multiple-sclerosis-an-overview-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a prevalent demyelinating disease that damages the protective covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting signal transmission in the nervous system. This disruption leads to various physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric symptoms, such as double vision, visual loss, muscle weakness, and issues with sensation or coordination. MS manifests in several forms, with symptoms either appearing in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or progressively building up over time. The cause of MS remains unclear, but it is believed to involve either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells. Potential causes include genetics and environmental factors like viral infections. Although no cure for MS exists, treatments aim to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. As of 2022, nearly one million people in the United States and about 2.8 million people globally have MS.</p>
<h1 id="symptoms-and-diagnosis-of-ms">Symptoms and Diagnosis of MS <a href="#symptoms-and-diagnosis-of-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>MS can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems. The specific symptoms depend on the locations of the lesions within the nervous system. Common symptoms include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, muscle weakness, blurred vision, pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems, fatigue, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties. Cognitive impairment and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. MS is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms and the results of supporting medical tests.</p>
<h1 id="causes-and-risk-factors-of-ms">Causes and Risk Factors of MS <a href="#causes-and-risk-factors-of-ms" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The cause of MS is unknown, but it is believed to occur as a result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as infectious agents. Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS. One hypothesis is that infection by a widespread microbe contributes to disease development, and the geographic distribution of this organism influences the epidemiology of MS. Epstein-Barr herpes virus (EBV) has been linked to MS, with compelling epidemiological and mechanistic evidence for a causal role of EBV in multiple sclerosis. MS is not considered a Mendelian disease, as many genetic variations have been shown to increase the risk. MS has a polygenic architecture, meaning that many genetic variants of relatively small effect add together to produce an overall genetic predisposition for MS. MS is more common in people who live farther from the equator, although exceptions exist. Other potential risk factors include smoking, stress, occupational exposures and toxins, vaccinations, diet, hormone intake, and obesity during adolescence and young adulthood.</p>

It is the most common demyelinating disease, a term that refers to diseases that damage the protective covering of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, known as myelin. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to transmit signals, resulting in a range of symptoms that can include physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-multiple-sclerosis">Overview of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#overview-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MS can take several forms, with symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). In the relapsing forms of MS, symptoms may disappear completely between attacks, although some permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.</p>
<p>The cause of MS is unclear, but it is thought to involve either destruction by the immune system or failure of the myelin-producing cells.

<h2 id="prevalence-of-multiple-sclerosis">Prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#prevalence-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MS is the most common immune-mediated disorder affecting the central nervous system. As of 2022, nearly one million people have MS in the United States. In 2020, about 2.8 million people were affected globally, with rates varying widely in different regions and among different populations. The disease usually begins between the ages of 20 and 50 and is twice as common in women as in men.</p>
<p>MS was first described in 1868 by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. The name &ldquo;multiple sclerosis&rdquo; is short for multiple cerebro-spinal sclerosis, which refers to the numerous glial scars (or sclerae ‚Äì essentially plaques or lesions) that develop on the white matter of the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<h2 id="signs-and-symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis">Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#signs-and-symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common. The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system.</p>
<p>These symptoms may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation, such as tingling, pins and needles, or numbness; muscle weakness, blurred vision, pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, difficulty in moving, difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain; and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as neurogenic bladder), among others.</p>
<p>When MS is more advanced, walking difficulties can occur and the risk of falling increases. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. The primary deficit in cognitive function that people with MS experience is slowed information-processing speed, with memory also commonly affected, and executive function less commonly. Intelligence, language, and semantic memory are usually preserved, and the level of cognitive impairment varies considerably between people with MS.</p>
<h2 id="prodromal-phase-of-multiple-sclerosis">Prodromal Phase of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#prodromal-phase-of-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MS may have a prodromal phase in the years leading up to MS manifestation, characterized by psychiatric issues, cognitive impairment, and increased use of healthcare. This phase can be considered as a period of subtle neurological changes that occur before the full-blown clinical presentation of MS.</p>
<h2 id="causes-of-multiple-sclerosis-1">Causes of Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#causes-of-multiple-sclerosis-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The cause of MS is unknown, but it is believed to occur as a result of some combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as infectious agents. Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS, with one hypothesis suggesting that infection by a widespread microbe contributes to disease development, and the geographic distribution of this organism influences the epidemiology of MS.</p>
<h3 id="infectious-agents-and-multiple-sclerosis">Infectious Agents and Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#infectious-agents-and-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Two opposing versions of this hypothesis include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis, the former being more favored. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective; the disease is a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that an early, persistent, and silent infection increases risk of disease, thus the disease is more common where the infectious agent is more common.</p>
<p>Evidence for a virus as a cause include the presence of oligoclonal bands in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelinating encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections.</p>
<h3 id="genetics-and-multiple-sclerosis">Genetics and Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#genetics-and-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>MS is not considered a Mendelian disease, as many, not just a few, genetic variations have been shown to increase the risk. MS has a polygenic architecture, meaning that many genetic variants of relatively small effect add together to produce an overall genetic predisposition for MS.</p>
<p>The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related. An identical twin of an affected individual has a 30% chance of developing MS, 5% for a nonidentical twin, 2.5% for a sibling, and an even lower chance for a half sibling. If both parents are affected, the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population.</p>
<h3 id="geography-and-multiple-sclerosis">Geography and Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#geography-and-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>MS is more common in people who live farther from the equator, although exceptions exist.

<p>The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While the north‚Äìsouth gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present. MS is more common in regions with northern European populations, so the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations.</p>
<h3 id="other-factors-and-multiple-sclerosis">Other Factors and Multiple Sclerosis <a href="#other-factors-and-multiple-sclerosis" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>Smoking may be an independent risk factor for MS.

Vaccinations were studied as causal factors; most studies, though, show no association. Several other possible risk factors, such as diet and hormone intake, have been evaluated, but evidence on their relation with the disease is &ldquo;sparse and unpersuasive&rdquo;. Gout occurs less than would be expected and lower levels of uric acid have been found in people with MS. This has led to the theory that uric acid is protective, although its exact importance remains unknown. Obesity during adolescence and young adulthood is a risk factor for MS.</p>

<h1 id="about-mythbusters">About MythBusters <a href="#about-mythbusters" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>MythBusters is a TV show about science. It was made by Peter Rees from Australia and started on the Discovery Channel in 2003. The show was hosted by special effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman. They used science to check if rumors, myths, movie scenes, and stories from the internet and news were true or false. The show was very popular and was filmed in San Francisco. They made 282 episodes before the show ended in 2016. In 2017, the show started again with new hosts Jon Lung and Brian Louden. They also made a version of MythBusters for kids called MythBusters Jr.</p>
<h1 id="the-team-behind-mythbusters">The Team Behind MythBusters <a href="#the-team-behind-mythbusters" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>In the second season of the show, a second team of MythBusters was created. This team was made up of people who helped Adam and Jamie behind the scenes. They tested myths separately from Adam and Jamie. In 2014, some members of this team left the show. Adam and Jamie then hosted the last two seasons by themselves. The most recent version of the show, called Motor MythBusters, started in 2021. It is about testing myths and stories about cars.</p>
<h1 id="how-mythbusters-works">How MythBusters Works <a href="#how-mythbusters-works" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Each episode of MythBusters usually focuses on two or more popular beliefs, rumors, or myths. The team uses a two-step process to test these myths. First, they try to recreate the circumstances of the myth to see if the same result happens. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, they change the circumstances to try and get the result the myth describes. They often build objects to help test the myth and use special equipment to measure the results. Sometimes, they use crash-test dummies or pig carcasses to simulate human bodies. They also use high-speed cameras to capture fast-moving objects.</p>

<h1 id="mythbusters-the-fun-science-show">MythBusters: The Fun Science Show <a href="#mythbusters-the-fun-science-show" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>MythBusters was a cool TV program all about science! The show was made by a man named Peter Rees and a company from Australia called Beyond Television Productions. The first episode was shown on a channel called the Discovery Channel on January 23, 2003. Lots of people around the world watched it on different TV channels.</p>
<p>The hosts of the show were Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman. They were both experts in special effects, which means they knew how to make things look real on TV and in movies. They used science to find out if rumors, myths, movie scenes, sayings, Internet videos, and news stories were true or not. The show was really popular, and only two other shows on the Discovery Channel in Canada had more people watching.</p>
<h2 id="where-and-when-it-was-filmed">Where and When It Was Filmed <a href="#where-and-when-it-was-filmed" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MythBusters was filmed in a city called San Francisco and the episodes were put together in a place called Artarmon, New South Wales. The show made 282 episodes before it stopped in March 2016. They planned and did some experiments at Jamie Hyneman&rsquo;s workshops in San Francisco. If they needed more room or special places for their experiments, they filmed those in different places around San Francisco and sometimes even in other states or countries!</p>
<h2 id="the-build-team">The Build Team <a href="#the-build-team" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>In the second season of the show, some people who worked behind the scenes with Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman were put together into a second team of MythBusters. This team was called &ldquo;The Build Team&rdquo;. They usually tested myths separately from Adam and Jamie and worked in a different workshop. This went on until August 2014, when it was announced that Tory Belleci, Kari Byron, and Grant Imahara would be leaving the show. After that, Adam and Jamie hosted the last two seasons of the show by themselves. The last season of MythBusters with the original cast was in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="new-hosts-and-revival">New Hosts and Revival <a href="#new-hosts-and-revival" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>On November 15, 2017, a channel called the Science Channel brought back the series with new hosts named Jon Lung and Brian Louden. They were chosen in a competition spin-off show called MythBusters: The Search. This new version of the show was filmed in Santa Clarita and other parts of Southern California. It lasted for two seasons until 2018. Adam Savage came back in a spin-off show called MythBusters Jr., which featured children.</p>
<p>The most recent version of MythBusters was called Motor Mythbusters. It was made by Beyond Television and aired on MotorTrend in 2021. Tory Belleci came back for this series, and he was joined by an engineer named Bisi Ezerioha and a mechanic named Faye Hadley. This series focused on testing myths and urban legends about cars.</p>
<h2 id="history-5">History <a href="#history-5" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The idea for MythBusters was developed by an Australian writer and producer named Peter Rees in 2002. The Discovery Channel initially didn&rsquo;t want to make the show because they already had a similar show. But Peter Rees changed his idea to focus on testing the key parts of the stories instead of just retelling them. The Discovery Channel agreed to make a three-episode pilot series. Jamie Hyneman was one of several special-effects artists who were asked to make a casting video for the network to consider. Adam Savage, who had worked with Jamie Hyneman before, was asked by Jamie to help host the show.</p>
<h2 id="cast">Cast <a href="#cast" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman were the original MythBusters. They used their experience with special effects to explore all the myths of the series. As the series continued, more members of Jamie&rsquo;s staff were introduced and started to appear regularly in episodes. Three of these members, artist Kari Byron, builder Tory Belleci, and metal-worker Scottie Chapman, were organized as a second team of MythBusters during the second season, called the &ldquo;Build Team&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="episodes">Episodes <a href="#episodes" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>There was no consistent system for organizing MythBusters episodes into seasons. The official MythBusters website lists episodes by year. However, Discovery sells DVD sets for &ldquo;seasons&rdquo;, which sometimes follow the calendar year and sometimes do not. Including Specials and the revival series, a total of 296 episodes of MythBusters have aired so far.</p>
<h2 id="format-and-experiment-approach">Format and Experiment Approach <a href="#format-and-experiment-approach" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Each MythBusters episode usually focused on two or more popular beliefs, Internet rumors, or other myths. The list of myths tested by the series came from many sources, including the personal experiences of the cast and crew, as well as fan suggestions. Sometimes, episodes were produced in which some or all of the myths were related by theme, such as pirates or sharks.</p>
<p>The MythBusters usually tested myths in a two-step process. First, the team tried to recreate the circumstances that the myth said, to see if the same thing happened. If that didn&rsquo;t work, they tried to make the circumstances bigger or more extreme to cause the thing from the myth to happen. This often showed that the claims of the myth were silly or impossible to achieve without special training or equipment.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the MythBusters refused to test some myths. Paranormal concepts, such as aliens or ghosts, were not tested because they couldn&rsquo;t be tested by scientific methods. The program also avoided experiments harmful to live animals.</p>

<h1 id="the-build-team-and-show-revival">The Build Team and Show Revival <a href="#the-build-team-and-show-revival" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>During the second season, a second team of MythBusters, known as &ldquo;The Build Team&rdquo;, was assembled. They tested myths separately from the main duo and operated from a different workshop. However, this arrangement ended in 2014, and the original hosts Savage and Hyneman hosted the final two seasons alone. In 2017, the Science Channel revived the series with new hosts Jon Lung and Brian Louden, who were selected via a competition spin-off.

<h1 id="mythbusters-a-comprehensive-overview">MythBusters: A Comprehensive Overview <a href="#mythbusters-a-comprehensive-overview" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><h2 id="introduction-8">Introduction <a href="#introduction-8" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MythBusters is an engaging and educational television show that blends science and entertainment. The show was developed by Peter Rees and produced by Beyond Television Productions, a company based in Australia. The series first aired on the Discovery Channel on January 23, 2003. The program was broadcasted internationally by numerous television networks and other Discovery channels across the globe.</p>
<p>The original hosts of the show were Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, both of whom are experts in special effects. They employed elements of the scientific method to test the validity of a wide range of subjects, including rumors, myths, movie scenes, adages, Internet videos, and news stories. The show was highly popular on the Discovery Channel, only surpassed by &lsquo;How It&rsquo;s Made&rsquo; and &lsquo;Daily Planet&rsquo;, both of which are Canadian shows.</p>
<h2 id="production-details">Production Details <a href="#production-details" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MythBusters was filmed in San Francisco and edited in Artarmon, New South Wales. The show aired a total of 282 episodes before it was cancelled at the end of the 2016 season in March. The planning and some experimentation for the show were conducted at Hyneman&rsquo;s workshops in San Francisco. Experiments that required more space or special accommodations were filmed on location, typically around the San Francisco Bay Area and other locations in northern California. On occasion, the production would venture to other states or even countries when necessary.</p>
<p>During the second season, members of Savage&rsquo;s and Hyneman&rsquo;s behind-the-scenes team were organized into a second team of MythBusters, known as &ldquo;The Build Team&rdquo;. They generally tested myths separately from the main duo and operated from another workshop. This arrangement continued until August 2014 when it was announced that Tory Belleci, Kari Byron, and Grant Imahara would be leaving the show. Savage and Hyneman then hosted the final two seasons alone. On October 21, 2015, it was announced that MythBusters would air its 14th and final season in 2016. The show aired its final episode with the original cast on March 6, 2016.</p>
<h2 id="revival-and-spin-offs">Revival and Spin-offs <a href="#revival-and-spin-offs" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>On November 15, 2017, the Science Channel, a sister network, revived the series with new hosts Jon Lung and Brian Louden, who were selected via the competition spin-off MythBusters: The Search. The revival was filmed in Santa Clarita and on location in other parts of Southern California, airing for two seasons that lasted until 2018. Savage would later return in MythBusters Jr., a spin-off featuring children.</p>
<p>The most recent iteration of the franchise, Motor Mythbusters, was produced by Beyond Television and aired on MotorTrend in 2021. Belleci returned for the series, and was joined by engineer Bisi Ezerioha and mechanic Faye Hadley. The series focused on testing myths and urban legends about automobiles.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;MythBusters&rdquo; refers to both the name of the program and the cast members who test the experiments.</p>
<h2 id="history-6">History <a href="#history-6" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The series concept was developed for the Discovery Channel as Tall Tales or True by Australian writer and producer Peter Rees of Beyond Productions in 2002. Discovery initially rejected the proposal because they had just commissioned a series on the same topic. Rees refined the pitch to focus on testing key elements of the stories rather than just retelling them. Discovery agreed to develop and co-produce a three-episode series pilot. Jamie Hyneman was one of a number of special-effects artists who were asked to prepare a casting video for network consideration. Rees had interviewed him previously for a segment of the popular science series Beyond 2000 about the British‚ÄìAmerican robot combat television series Robot Wars. Adam Savage, who had worked with Hyneman in commercials and on the robot combat television series BattleBots, was asked by Hyneman to help co-host the show because, according to Savage, Hyneman thought himself too uninteresting to host the series on his own.</p>
<p>During July 2006, an edited 30-minute version of MythBusters began airing on BBC Two in the UK. The episodes shown on the European Discovery Channel sometimes include extra scenes not shown in the United States version (some of these scenes are included eventually in &ldquo;specials&rdquo;, such as &ldquo;MythBusters Outtakes&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The 14th season, which premiered in January 2016, was the final season for the series with Savage and Hyneman. Adam Savage returned to TV with the show MythBusters Jr., without his original co-host Jamie Hyneman, but with a cast of teenagers, hence the name. The show debuted on the Science Channel on January 2, 2019 with rebroadcasts every Saturday morning on Discovery, as well as international broadcasts.</p>
<h2 id="cast-1">Cast <a href="#cast-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman are the original MythBusters, and initially explored all the myths of the series using their combined experience with special effects. The two worked at Hyneman&rsquo;s effects workshop, M5 Industries; they made use of his staff, who often worked off-screen, with Hyneman and Savage usually shown doing most of the work at the shop. The show is narrated by Robert Lee, though in some regions, his voice is replaced by a local narrator.</p>
<p>As the series progressed, members of Hyneman&rsquo;s staff were introduced and began to appear regularly in episodes. Three such members, artist Kari Byron, builder Tory Belleci, and metal-worker Scottie Chapman, were organized as a second team of MythBusters during the second season, dubbed the &ldquo;Build Team&rdquo;. After Chapman left the show during the third season, Grant Imahara, a colleague of Hyneman&rsquo;s, was hired to provide the team with his electrical and robotics experience. Byron went on maternity leave in mid-2009, with her position on the Build Team temporarily filled by Jessi Combs, best known for co-hosting Spike&rsquo;s Xtreme 4x4. Byron returned in the third episode of 2010 season. The Build Team worked at its own workshop, called M7, investigating separate myths from the original duo. Each episode typically alternated between the two teams covering different myths. During the Build Team&rsquo;s tenure, Belleci was the only member to appear in every myth that the team tested. At the end of the 2014 season finale &ldquo;Plane Boarding&rdquo;, Savage and Hyneman announced that Byron, Belleci, and Imahara would not be returning in the 2015 season. This was reportedly over salary negotiations due to the rising cost of five hosts. Hyneman and Savage returned to being the sole hosts. Byron, Belleci, and Imahara went on to host Netflix&rsquo;s White Rabbit Project.</p>
<p>The series had two interns, dubbed &ldquo;Mythterns&rdquo;: Discovery Channel contest winner Christine Chamberlain and viewer building contest-winner Jess Nelson. During the first season, the program featured segments with folklorist Heather Joseph-Witham, who explained the origins of certain myths, and other people who had first-hand experience with the myths being tested, but those elements were phased out early in the series. The MythBusters commonly consulted experts for myths or topics for which they needed assistance. These topics included firearms, for which they mostly consulted Lt. Al Normandy of the South San Francisco Police Department, and explosives, for which they consulted retired FBI explosives expert Frank Doyle and Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. The MythBusters often asked other people, such as those supplying the equipment being tested, what they knew about the myth under investigation. When guests were on the show, the MythBusters generally consulted them or included them in the experiments.</p>
<h2 id="episodes-1">Episodes <a href="#episodes-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MythBusters did not use a consistent system for organizing its episodes into seasons. The program did not follow a typical calendar of on- and off-air periods. The official MythBusters website lists episodes by year. However, Discovery sells DVD sets for &ldquo;seasons&rdquo;, which sometimes follow the calendar year and sometimes do not. In addition, Discovery and retail stores also sell &ldquo;collections&rdquo; which divide up the episodes in a different way; each collection has about 10 or 12 episodes from various seasons. Including Specials and the revival series, a total of 296 episodes of MythBusters have aired so far.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format <a href="#format" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Each episode of MythBusters typically focuses on two or more popular beliefs, Internet rumors, or other myths. Many of the myths are on mechanical effects as portrayed in live-action films and television of fictional incidents. The list of myths tested by the series is compiled from many sources, including the personal experiences of cast and crew, as well as fan suggestions, such as those posted on the Discovery Channel online MythBusters forums. Occasionally, episodes are produced in which some or all of the myths are related by theme, such as pirates or sharks, and occasionally these are dubbed as &ldquo;[Theme] Special&rdquo; episodes. As of May 2009, four myths have required such extensive preparation and testing that they had entire episodes devoted solely to them, and four specials have been double-length. Several episodes (including the 2006 Holiday Special) have included the building of Rube Goldberg machines. Before a myth is introduced by the hosts, a myth-related drawing is made on a blueprint. After the hosts introduce the myth, a comical video explaining the myth is usually shown.</p>
<h3 id="experiment-approach">Experiment Approach <a href="#experiment-approach" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The MythBusters typically test myths in a two-step process. In early episodes, the steps were described as &ldquo;replicate the circumstances, then duplicate the results&rdquo; by Savage. This means that first the team attempts to recreate the circumstances that the myth alleges, to determine whether the alleged result occurs; if that fails, they attempt to expand the circumstances to the point that will cause the described result, which often reveals that the claims of the myth are objectively ridiculous or impossible to achieve without specialized training or equipment. Occasionally, the team (usually Savage and Hyneman) holds a friendly competition between themselves to see which of them can devise a more successful solution to recreating the results. This is most common with myths involving building an object that can accomplish a goal (for example, rapidly cooling a beer, or finding a needle in a haystack).</p>
<p>While the team obeys no specific formula in terms of physical procedure, most myths involve construction of various objects to help test the myth. They use their functional workshops to construct whatever is needed, often including mechanical devices and sets to simulate the circumstances of the myth. Human actions are often simulated by mechanical means to increase safety, and to achieve consistency in repeated actions. Methods for testing myths are usually planned and executed in a manner to produce visually dramatic results, which generally involves explosions, fires, or vehicle crashes. Thus, myths or tests involving explosives, firearms and vehicle collisions are relatively common.</p>
<p>Tests are sometimes confined to the workshop, but often require the teams to be outside. Much of the outdoor testing during early seasons took place in the parking lot of M5, and occasionally M6 and M7. A cargo container in the M7 parking lot commonly serves as an isolation room for dangerous myths, with the experiment being triggered from outside. However, budget increases have permitted more frequent travel to other locations in San Francisco and around the Bay Area. Common filming locations around the Bay Area include decommissioned (closed) military facilities (such as Naval Air Station Alameda, Naval Air Station Moffett Field, Concord Naval Weapons Station, Naval Station Treasure Island, Marin Headlands, Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and Hamilton Air Force Base, and abandoned base housing at Marina, California&rsquo;s former Fort Ord), and the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s facility in Dublin, California, especially the firing range, emergency-vehicles operation course, and bomb range. Occasionally, mainly for special episodes, production is out of state, or even out of the country.</p>
<p>Results are measured in a manner scientifically appropriate for the given experiment. Sometimes, results can be measured by simple numerical measurement using standard tools, such as multimeters for electrical measurements, or various types of thermometers to measure temperature. To gauge results that do not yield numerical quantities, the teams commonly make use of several types of equipment that can provide other forms of observable effects. When testing physical consequences to a human body, which would be too dangerous to test on a living person, the MythBusters commonly use analogues. Initially, they mainly used crash-test dummies (usually, whatever form and function it possessed, it would be named Buster) for observing blunt trauma injury, and ballistic gelatin for testing penetrating trauma. They have since progressed to using pig carcasses when an experiment requires a more accurate simulation of human flesh, bone, and organs. They have also occasionally molded real or simulated bones within ballistics gel for simulations of specific body parts. They have also used synthetic cadavers (or SynDavers) such as in the &ldquo;Car Cushion&rdquo; myth.</p>
<p>Both for the purposes of visual observation to determine a result and simply as a unique visual for the program, high-speed cameras are used during experiments and have become a trademark of the series. Very fast footage of moving objects in front of a measured scale is commonly used to determine the speed of the object.</p>
<p>Testing is often edited due to time constraints of a televised episode. It can often seem as if the teams draw results from fewer repetitions and a smaller data set than they actually have. During the &ldquo;Outtakes Special&rdquo;, they specifically stated that while they are, in fact, very thorough in testing myths and repeat experiments many times in many different configurations, it is simply impossible to display the entire process during a program. Beginning in the fifth season, episodes typically contain a prompt for the viewer to visit the show&rsquo;s homepage to view outtake footage of either additional testing or other facets of the myths being tested. However, Savage himself has acknowledged that they do not purport always to achieve a satisfactorily large enough set of results to overcome definitively all bias. In response to criticisms they receive about their methods and results in previous episodes, the staff produced several &ldquo;Myths Revisited&rdquo; episodes in which the teams retest myths to see if the complaints have merit. These episodes have sometimes resulted in overturning results of several myths, as well as upholding some results for reasons different from the original.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the MythBusters take the opportunity to test &ldquo;mini-myths&rdquo; during the course of one of the episode&rsquo;s main myths, usually in the name of satisfying personal curiosity. These can either be planned in advance to take advantage of the testing location‚Äîfor instance, in the &ldquo;Peeing on the Third Rail&rdquo; myth Adam got permission to find out if placing coins on a train track was sufficient to derail a train (he found that the test locomotive was not affected at all)‚Äîor can simply take place without prior planning.</p>
<p>MythBusters refuse to test some myths. Paranormal concepts, such as aliens or ghosts, are not addressed because they cannot be tested by scientific methods, although one exception, pyramid power, prompted Adam to comment, &ldquo;No more &lsquo;oogie-boogie&rsquo; myths, please&rdquo; and state at a tour show in Indianapolis in 2012 that it was a mistake. Another myth related to the paranormal was the &ldquo;Haunted Hum&rdquo; myth, which involved testing if a particular, inaudible sound frequency can lead people to believe that an area is haunted. The program generally avoids experiments harmful to live animals, though in one episode, they bombarded cockroaches and other laboratory insects with lethal doses of radiation; the cast addressed this, saying that the insects were specifically bred for experiments and would have likely died anyway. However, animal carcasses (including those of pigs and chickens) are often used, but the MythBusters have repeatedly emphasized that the animals have died of natural causes.</p>

During its second season, a second team of MythBusters, known as &ldquo;The Build Team&rdquo;, was organized and operated separately from the main duo.</p>
<h1 id="mythbusters-history-and-evolution">MythBusters: History and Evolution <a href="#mythbusters-history-and-evolution" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The series concept was initially rejected by Discovery Channel but was later refined to focus on testing key elements of stories rather than just retelling them. The original hosts, Savage and Hyneman, were joined by a second team, &ldquo;The Build Team&rdquo;, in the second season.

<h1 id="mythbusters-format-and-approach">MythBusters: Format and Approach <a href="#mythbusters-format-and-approach" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Each MythBusters episode typically focuses on testing two or more popular beliefs, Internet rumors, or other myths. The myths are tested in a two-step process: first, the team attempts to recreate the circumstances that the myth alleges, then they attempt to expand the circumstances to achieve the described result. The show is known for its use of special effects, including explosions, fires, and vehicle crashes. The results of the experiments are measured using scientifically appropriate methods, and the testing process is often edited for time constraints of a televised episode. The show has also produced several &ldquo;Myths Revisited&rdquo; episodes in response to criticisms about their methods and results in previous episodes.</p>

<h1 id="mythbusters-the-science-entertainment-program">MythBusters: The Science Entertainment Program <a href="#mythbusters-the-science-entertainment-program" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>MythBusters is a science entertainment television program that originated from Australia&rsquo;s Beyond Television Productions, with Peter Rees as the developer. The series made its debut on the Discovery Channel on January 23, 2003. It gained international recognition, being broadcast by numerous television networks and other Discovery channels worldwide. The original hosts of the show were Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, both specialists in special effects. They utilized elements of the scientific method to validate the authenticity of rumors, myths, movie scenes, adages, Internet videos, and news stories. The show was one of the most popular on Discovery Channel, surpassed only by How It&rsquo;s Made and Daily Planet, both in Canada.</p>
<h2 id="production-and-filming">Production and Filming <a href="#production-and-filming" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The show was filmed in San Francisco and edited in Artarmon, New South Wales. It aired a total of 282 episodes before its cancellation at the end of the 2016 season in March. Planning and some experimentation took place at Hyneman&rsquo;s workshops in San Francisco. Experiments that required more space or special accommodations were filmed on location, typically around the San Francisco Bay Area and other locations in northern California. The team would occasionally travel to other states or even other countries when necessary.</p>
<h2 id="the-build-team-1">The Build Team <a href="#the-build-team-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>During the second season, members of Savage&rsquo;s and Hyneman&rsquo;s behind-the-scenes team were organized into a second team of MythBusters, known as &ldquo;The Build Team&rdquo;. This team generally tested myths separately from the main duo and operated from a different workshop. This arrangement continued until August 2014, when it was announced that Tory Belleci, Kari Byron, and Grant Imahara would be leaving the show. Savage and Hyneman subsequently hosted the final two seasons alone.</p>
<h2 id="the-end-and-revival">The End and Revival <a href="#the-end-and-revival" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>On October 21, 2015, it was announced that MythBusters would air its 14th and final season in 2016. The show aired its final episode with the original cast on March 6, 2016. However, on November 15, 2017, sister network Science Channel revived the series with new hosts Jon Lung and Brian Louden, who were selected via the competition spin-off MythBusters: The Search. The revival was filmed in Santa Clarita and on location in other parts of Southern California, airing for two seasons that lasted until 2018. Savage would later return in MythBusters Jr., a spin-off featuring children.</p>
<h2 id="motor-mythbusters">Motor MythBusters <a href="#motor-mythbusters" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The most recent iteration of the franchise, Motor MythBusters, was produced by Beyond Television and aired on MotorTrend in 2021. Belleci returned for the series, and was joined by engineer Bisi Ezerioha and mechanic Faye Hadley. The series focused on testing myths and urban legends about automobiles.</p>
<h1 id="history-7">History <a href="#history-7" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>The series concept was initially developed for the Discovery Channel as Tall Tales or True by Australian writer and producer Peter Rees of Beyond Productions in 2002. However, Discovery initially rejected the proposal because they had just commissioned a series on the same topic. Rees refined the pitch to focus on testing key elements of the stories rather than just retelling them. Discovery agreed to develop and co-produce a three-episode series pilot. Special-effects artist Jamie Hyneman was one of several artists who were asked to prepare a casting video for network consideration. Adam Savage, who had worked with Hyneman in commercials and on the robot combat television series BattleBots, was asked by Hyneman to help co-host the show.</p>
<h2 id="international-broadcast">International Broadcast <a href="#international-broadcast" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>During July 2006, an edited 30-minute version of MythBusters began airing on BBC Two in the UK. The episodes shown on the European Discovery Channel sometimes include extra scenes not shown in the United States version. The 14th season, which premiered in January 2016, was the final season for the series with Savage and Hyneman. Adam Savage returned to TV with the show MythBusters Jr., without his original co-host Jamie Hyneman, but with a cast of teenagers.</p>
<h1 id="cast-2">Cast <a href="#cast-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, the original MythBusters, initially explored all the myths of the series using their combined experience with special effects. As the series progressed, members of Hyneman&rsquo;s staff were introduced and began to appear regularly in episodes. Three such members, artist Kari Byron, builder Tory Belleci, and metal-worker Scottie Chapman, were organized as a second team of MythBusters during the second season, dubbed the &ldquo;Build Team&rdquo;. The show is narrated by Robert Lee, though in some regions, his voice is replaced by a local narrator.</p>
<h2 id="build-team">Build Team <a href="#build-team" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>After Chapman left the show during the third season, Grant Imahara, a colleague of Hyneman&rsquo;s, was hired to provide the team with his electrical and robotics experience. Byron went on maternity leave in mid-2009, with her position on the Build Team temporarily filled by Jessi Combs, best known for co-hosting Spike&rsquo;s Xtreme 4x4. Byron returned in the third episode of 2010 season. The Build Team worked at its own workshop, called M7, investigating separate myths from the original duo. At the end of the 2014 season finale &ldquo;Plane Boarding&rdquo;, Savage and Hyneman announced that Byron, Belleci, and Imahara would not be returning in the 2015 season. This was reportedly over salary negotiations due to the rising cost of five hosts. Hyneman and Savage returned to being the sole hosts. Byron, Belleci, and Imahara went on to host Netflix&rsquo;s White Rabbit Project.</p>
<h1 id="episodes-2">Episodes <a href="#episodes-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>No consistent system was used for organizing MythBusters episodes into seasons. The program has never followed a typical calendar of on- and off-air periods. The official MythBusters website lists episodes by year. However, Discovery sells DVD sets for &ldquo;seasons&rdquo;, which sometimes follow the calendar year and sometimes do not. In addition, Discovery and retail stores also sell &ldquo;collections&rdquo; which divide up the episodes in a different way; each collection has about 10 or 12 episodes from various seasons. Including Specials and the revival series, a total of 296 episodes of MythBusters have aired so far.</p>
<h1 id="format-1">Format <a href="#format-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>Each MythBusters episode typically focuses on two or more popular beliefs, Internet rumors, or other myths. Many of the myths are on mechanical effects as portrayed in live-action films and television of fictional incidents. The list of myths tested by the series is compiled from many sources, including the personal experiences of cast and crew, as well as fan suggestions, such as those posted on the Discovery Channel online MythBusters forums.</p>
<h2 id="experiment-approach-1">Experiment Approach <a href="#experiment-approach-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>The MythBusters typically test myths in a two-step process. In early episodes, the steps were described as &ldquo;replicate the circumstances, then duplicate the results&rdquo; by Savage. This means that first the team attempts to recreate the circumstances that the myth alleges, to determine whether the alleged result occurs; if that fails, they attempt to expand the circumstances to the point that will cause the described result. Occasionally, the team holds a friendly competition between themselves to see which of them can devise a more successful solution to recreating the results.</p>
<h2 id="testing-and-results">Testing and Results <a href="#testing-and-results" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Tests are sometimes confined to the workshop, but often require the teams to be outside. Results are measured in a manner scientifically appropriate for the given experiment. Sometimes, results can be measured by simple numerical measurement using standard tools. To gauge results that do not yield numerical quantities, the teams commonly make use of several types of equipment that can provide other forms of observable effects. High-speed cameras are used during experiments and have become a trademark of the series.</p>
<h2 id="exclusions">Exclusions <a href="#exclusions" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>MythBusters refuse to test some myths. Paranormal concepts, such as aliens or ghosts, are not addressed because they cannot be tested by scientific methods. The program generally avoids experiments harmful to live animals. However, animal carcasses (including those of pigs and chickens) are often used, but the MythBusters have repeatedly emphasized that the animals have died of natural causes.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-11">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion-11" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><p>MythBusters has been an influential science entertainment television program that has debunked and confirmed numerous myths through scientific methods. Despite its cancellation, the show&rsquo;s legacy continues through its spin-offs and the impact it has made in popular culture.</p>

<h2 id="revival-and-spin-offs-1">Revival and Spin-offs <a href="#revival-and-spin-offs-1" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>On November 15, 2017, sister network Science Channel revived the series with new hosts Jon Lung and Brian Louden, who were selected via the competition spin-off MythBusters: The Search.

Jamie Hyneman was one of a number of special-effects artists who were asked to prepare a casting video for network consideration. Rees had interviewed him previously for a segment of the popular science series Beyond 2000 about the British‚ÄìAmerican robot combat television series Robot Wars. Adam Savage, who had worked with Hyneman in commercials and on the robot combat television series BattleBots, was asked by Hyneman to help co-host the show because, according to Savage, Hyneman thought himself too uninteresting to host the series on his own.</p>
<p>During July 2006, an edited 30-minute version of MythBusters began airing on BBC Two in the UK. The episodes shown on the European Discovery Channel sometimes include extra scenes not shown in the United States version (some of these scenes are included eventually in &ldquo;specials&rdquo;, such as &ldquo;MythBusters Outtakes&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The 14th season, which premiered in January 2016, was the final season for the series with Savage and Hyneman. Adam Savage returned to TV with the show MythBusters Jr., without his original co-host Jamie Hyneman, but with a cast of teenagers, hence the name. The show debuted on the Science Channel on January 2, 2019 with rebroadcasts every Saturday morning on Discovery, as well as international broadcasts.</p>
<h2 id="cast-3">Cast <a href="#cast-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman are the original MythBusters, and initially explored all the myths of the series using their combined experience with special effects. The two worked at Hyneman&rsquo;s effects workshop, M5 Industries; they made use of his staff, who often worked off-screen, with Hyneman and Savage usually shown doing most of the work at the shop. The show is narrated by Robert Lee, though in some regions, his voice is replaced by a local narrator.</p>
<p>As the series progressed, members of Hyneman&rsquo;s staff were introduced and began to appear regularly in episodes. Three such members, artist Kari Byron, builder Tory Belleci, and metal-worker Scottie Chapman, were organized as a second team of MythBusters during the second season, dubbed the &ldquo;Build Team&rdquo;.

Byron went on maternity leave in mid-2009, with her position on the Build Team temporarily filled by Jessi Combs, best known for co-hosting Spike&rsquo;s Xtreme 4x4. Byron returned in the third episode of 2010 season. The Build Team worked at its own workshop, called M7, investigating separate myths from the original duo. Each episode typically alternated between the two teams covering different myths. During the Build Team&rsquo;s tenure, Belleci was the only member to appear in every myth that the team tested. At the end of the 2014 season finale &ldquo;Plane Boarding&rdquo;, Savage and Hyneman announced that Byron, Belleci, and Imahara would not be returning in the 2015 season. This was reportedly over salary negotiations due to the rising cost of five hosts. Hyneman and Savage returned to being the sole hosts. Byron, Belleci, and Imahara went on to host Netflix&rsquo;s White Rabbit Project.</p>
<p>The series had two interns, dubbed &ldquo;Mythterns&rdquo;: Discovery Channel contest winner Christine Chamberlain and viewer building contest-winner Jess Nelson. During the first season, the program featured segments with folklorist Heather Joseph-Witham, who explained the origins of certain myths, and other people who had first-hand experience with the myths being tested, but those elements were phased out early in the series. The MythBusters commonly consulted experts for myths or topics for which they needed assistance. These topics included firearms, for which they mostly consulted Lt. Al Normandy of the South San Francisco Police Department, and explosives, for which they consulted retired FBI explosives expert Frank Doyle and Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. The MythBusters often asked other people, such as those supplying the equipment being tested, what they knew about the myth under investigation. When guests were on the show, the MythBusters generally consulted them or included them in the experiments.</p>
<h2 id="episodes-3">Episodes <a href="#episodes-3" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>No consistent system was used for organizing MythBusters episodes into seasons. The program has never followed a typical calendar of on- and off-air periods. The official MythBusters website lists episodes by year. However, Discovery sells DVD sets for &ldquo;seasons&rdquo;, which sometimes follow the calendar year and sometimes do not. In addition, Discovery and retail stores also sell &ldquo;collections&rdquo; which divide up the episodes in a different way; each collection has about 10 or 12 episodes from various seasons. Including Specials and the revival series, a total of 296 episodes of MythBusters have aired so far.</p>
<h2 id="format-2">Format <a href="#format-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Each MythBusters episode focuses typically on two or more popular beliefs, Internet rumors, or other myths. Many of the myths are on mechanical effects as portrayed in live-action films and television of fictional incidents. The list of myths tested by the series is compiled from many sources, including the personal experiences of cast and crew, as well as fan suggestions, such as those posted on the Discovery Channel online MythBusters forums. Occasionally, episodes are produced in which some or all of the myths are related by theme, such as pirates or sharks, and occasionally these are dubbed as &ldquo;[Theme] Special&rdquo; episodes. As of May 2009, four myths have required such extensive preparation and testing that they had entire episodes devoted solely to them, and four specials have been double-length. Several episodes (including the 2006 Holiday Special) have included the building of Rube Goldberg machines. Before a myth is introduced by the hosts, a myth-related drawing is made on a blueprint. After the hosts introduce the myth, a comical video explaining the myth is usually shown.</p>
<h3 id="experiment-approach-2">Experiment Approach <a href="#experiment-approach-2" class="anchor">üîó</a></h3><p>The MythBusters typically test myths in a two-step process. In early episodes, the steps were described as &ldquo;replicate the circumstances, then duplicate the results&rdquo; by Savage. This means that first the team attempts to recreate the circumstances that the myth alleges, to determine whether the alleged result occurs; if that fails, they attempt to expand the circumstances to the point that will cause the described result, which often reveals that the claims of the myth are objectively ridiculous or impossible to achieve without specialized training or equipment. Occasionally, the team (usually Savage and Hyneman) holds a friendly competition between themselves to see which of them can devise a more successful solution to recreating the results. This is most common with myths involving building an object that can accomplish a goal (for example, rapidly cooling a beer, or finding a needle in a haystack).</p>
<p>While the team obeys no specific formula in terms of physical procedure, most myths involve construction of various objects to help test the myth. They use their functional workshops to construct whatever is needed, often including mechanical devices and sets to simulate the circumstances of the myth. Human actions are often simulated by mechanical means to increase safety, and to achieve consistency in repeated actions. Methods for testing myths are usually planned and executed in a manner to produce visually dramatic results, which generally involves explosions, fires, or vehicle crashes. Thus, myths or tests involving explosives, firearms and vehicle collisions are relatively common.</p>
<p>Tests are sometimes confined to the workshop, but often require the teams to be outside. Much of the outdoor testing during early seasons took place in the parking lot of M5, and occasionally M6 and M7. A cargo container in the M7 parking lot commonly serves as an isolation room for dangerous myths, with the experiment being triggered from outside. However, budget increases have permitted more frequent travel to other locations in San Francisco and around the Bay Area. Common filming locations around the Bay Area include decommissioned (closed) military facilities (such as Naval Air Station Alameda, Naval Air Station Moffett Field, Concord Naval Weapons Station, Naval Station Treasure Island, Marin Headlands, Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and Hamilton Air Force Base, and abandoned base housing at Marina, California&rsquo;s former Fort Ord), and the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s facility in Dublin, California, especially the firing range, emergency-vehicles operation course, and bomb range. Occasionally, mainly for special episodes, production is out of state, or even out of the country.</p>
<p>Results are measured in a manner scientifically appropriate for the given experiment. Sometimes, results can be measured by simple numerical measurement using standard tools, such as multimeters for electrical measurements, or various types of thermometers to measure temperature. To gauge results that do not yield numerical quantities, the teams commonly make use of several types of equipment that can provide other forms of observable effects. When testing physical consequences to a human body, which would be too dangerous to test on a living person, the MythBusters commonly use analogues. Initially, they mainly used crash-test dummies (usually, whatever form and function it possessed, it would be named Buster) for observing blunt trauma injury, and ballistic gelatin for testing penetrating trauma. They have since progressed to using pig carcasses when an experiment requires a more accurate simulation of human flesh, bone, and organs. They have also occasionally molded real or simulated bones within ballistics gel for simulations of specific body parts. They have also used synthetic cadavers (or SynDavers) such as in the &ldquo;Car Cushion&rdquo; myth.</p>
<p>Both for the purposes of visual observation to determine a result and simply as a unique visual for the program, high-speed cameras are used during experiments and have become a trademark of the series. Very fast footage of moving objects in front of a measured scale is commonly used to determine the speed of the object.</p>
<p>Testing is often edited due to time constraints of a televised episode. It can often seem as if the teams draw results from fewer repetitions and a smaller data set than they actually have. During the &ldquo;Outtakes Special&rdquo;, they specifically stated that while they are, in fact, very thorough in testing myths and repeat experiments many times in many different configurations, it is simply impossible to display the entire process during a program. Beginning in the fifth season, episodes typically contain a prompt for the viewer to visit the show&rsquo;s homepage to view outtake footage of either additional testing or other facets of the myths being tested. However, Savage himself has acknowledged that they do not purport always to achieve a satisfactorily large enough set of results to overcome definitively all bias. In response to criticisms they receive about their methods and results in previous episodes, the staff produced several &ldquo;Myths Revisited&rdquo; episodes in which the teams retest myths to see if the complaints have merit. These episodes have sometimes resulted in overturning results of several myths, as well as upholding some results for reasons different from the original.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the MythBusters take the opportunity to test &ldquo;mini-myths&rdquo; during the course of one of the episode&rsquo;s main myths, usually in the name of satisfying personal curiosity. These can either be planned in advance to take advantage of the testing location‚Äîfor instance, in the &ldquo;Peeing on the Third Rail&rdquo; myth Adam got permission to find out if placing coins on a train track was sufficient to derail a train (he found that the test locomotive was not affected at all)‚Äîor can simply take place without prior planning.</p>
<p>MythBusters refuse to test some myths. Paranormal concepts, such as aliens or ghosts, are not addressed because they cannot be tested by scientific methods, although one exception, pyramid power, prompted Adam to comment, &ldquo;No more &lsquo;oogie-boogie&rsquo; myths, please&rdquo; and state at a tour show in Indianapolis in 2012 that it was a mistake. Another myth related to the paranormal was the &ldquo;Haunted Hum&rdquo; myth, which involved testing if a particular, inaudible sound frequency can lead people to believe that an area is haunted. The program generally avoids experiments harmful to live animals, though in one episode, they bombarded cockroaches and other laboratory insects with lethal doses of radiation; the cast addressed this, saying that the insects were specifically bred for experiments and would have likely died anyway. However, animal carcasses (including those of pigs and chickens) are often used, but the MythBusters have repeatedly emphasized that the animals have died of natural causes.</p>
