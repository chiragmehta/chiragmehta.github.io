# About this page

This page explains why and how I made this **[Readability Demo](/posts/readability-demo)**. Feel free to check it out first and then come back here.

# Need for simplicity

<!--begin-->

Wikipedia is a great resource for getting a quick overview of a topic. But sometimes the articles are too long or too technical. [Simple Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org) helps, although it can still be pretty [lengthy](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer) and not always simple enough. Or it might be too simple, depending on what I am trying to learn. I've always wanted to be able to choose the level of detail and length based on what I am looking. Sometimes when I am researching a new topic and come across 10 new terms, all linking to their own detailed Wikipedia pages, I just want to get a 50-100 word gist. Other times, I want to get a 1000-word summary of a topic I am sort of familiar with but don't know well enough.

I have this same need for other text-based content like news articles and technical documents. And I believe a solution for this would improve readability and thus improve comprehension for everyone.

# Readability & Comprehension

**Readability** refers to the ease with which a reader can read and understand a written text. It is influenced by factors such as sentence length, word complexity, and the structure of the text.

**Comprehension** is the reader's ability to absorb and interpret the information presented in the text. The best way to explain any concept or information is to cater to the reader's level of understanding and prior knowledge. This can be achieved by using familiar language, breaking down complex ideas into smaller parts, and using examples or analogies that the reader can relate to.

## Readable content is easier to comprehend

## Reading Level & Length

Modern browsers like Safari and Chrome, e-book readers like Kindle, and word processors like MS Word and Google Docs make it easy to read text on a screen by letting the user set the zoom-level or font-size. Some even simplify the view by removing ads, sidebars, and other distractions, as well as using high contrast colors for the text and background. I think someday in the future, along with adjusting zoom-level, font-size, and colors, we will have a couple of more sliders in every reader: level and length.

**Level** is reading comprehension level, from 1st grade to 12th grade, from college first year to 20-year expert in field. Level can also automatically use sensible euphemisms for younger readers to reduce the details of gore, violence, or explicit verbiage.

**Length** is for specifying the number of words, from summary (50-100 words) to detailed (1000-1500 words). Length is about focusing on the core concepts of the text to best explain the material, and not just listing the "Top 5 Things About..."

## UX Preview

This is the current Mobile Safari Reader options panel:

{{< style >}}
    @media only screen and (max-width: 500px) {
        figure { margin: 0; }
    }
{{< /style >}}

{{< figure src="safari-read.jpg" alt="Mobile Safari Readability options at present" width="320" >}}

This is what I hope to see someday, not just in Safari but in every browser:

{{< figure src="safari-want.png" alt="Browser Readability options in future" width="320" >}}

A similar user interface could also be shown when selecting any text. In addition to copy, share, web search, and define menu options, users could be offered an "Explain" option that would let them choose the level and length of the explanation.

## How this could work

At present, [ChatGPT 4](https://openai.com/gpt-4) by OpenAI is the only AI [large language model (LLM)](/glossary/#llm) capable of doing an acceptable job at taking a few pages worth of text and rewriting it to a different reading comprehension level at a different length. I tried a few different cloud LLMs, but their results were not good enough. Either way, cloud LLMs are not an acceptable path forward because they can get expensive for longer source texts, do not work without Internet connection, and there are privacy and copyright concerns with sending full text to third parties.

My hope is that [local LLMs](/glossary/#rlocalllama) will continue to improve and in a few years (maybe 5-10), almost all consumer-level devices will have their own version of GPT 4+, capable of re-explaining or rewriting any source content, without the need for an Internet connection. It is already [possible](https://webllm.mlc.ai/) as a proof-of-concept using graphics cards on newer laptops and phones. Give it a few more years of innovation, and we'll wonder how we lived without it, like search engines and smartphones.

While major browsers might take a few years to bundle this feature, popular news sites might start offering "Readability" options for their articles. It would be akin to offering the same article in multiple languages.

## Disclaimer for rewritten content

There should always be an option to view original source text and any rewritten text should be clearly highlighted. Thankfully, we already have those types of identifying markers and warnings when translating between languages today. LLMs can be used to perform *translations* within the same language to address varying comprehension levels at multiple word lengths and the same type of warnings should be shown.

## Would this actually work and be useful?

I think so. And that is why I spent $25 on GPT 4 API to rewrite these 5 Wikipedia articles at 4 different levels and 3 different lengths each. Converting all [6.6 million articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia) on English Wikipedia would cost about $10-15 million at this rate, not cheap but also not impossible.

Dear OpenAI and Anthropic, please make wiki.openai.com or wiki.anthropic.com happen! Make it work like the demo here: **[Readability Demo](/posts/readability-demo)**

# How I made the demo

## Selecting parameters

After I experimented with rewriting text content in a lot of different ways with number of local and cloud LLM APIs for weeks, I settled on using specific grade level and length system prompts for ChatGPT 4 API. I ended up with 4 reading levels and 3 different word lengths. In addition to being expensive, GPT output was not substantially different for every grade level and due to the non-deterministic nature of output, sometimes grade 4-5 would be more complex than grade 6-7, or text limited to 50-100 words would be longer than text for 150-200 words. Here are the final parameters:

### Level
* 2nd Grade Student (age 7)
* 8th Grade Student (age 13)
* College Graduate (age 22)
* Expert in Field (age 40)

### Length
* 50-100 words (1-3 sentences)
* 500-750 words (3-4 short paragraphs in 2 sections)
* 1000-2000 words (full length 4-5 pages, 20-25 long paragraphs in 5+ sections)

## Articles

I tried out various combinations of the above parameters with a few different Wikipedia articles until the results matched my expectations and then finalized a variety of articles. I wrote a script that downloads the plain-text version of each article once, and then calls ChatGPT 4 API for every combination of selected level and length (total 12 times) per article. Shorter lengths cost less, longer ones more.

## System Prompts

When I said I tried out various combinations above, I meant I played around with detailed, custom prompts for each combination. Prompt just means what you want the GPT to do and how you want it to respond. I started with a generic "Rewrite the following text in 50-100 words (1-3 sentences) such that a 2nd Grade Student (age 7) can understand it." It sounds like it should work, but unfortunately it did not for most articles.

Often the language in the response came out more complex or the length was unpredictable. LLMs just aren't good enough to read between the lines yet. You have to specify a lot more in a prompt - what should the tone of the output be? Funny or dry? How detailed should the factual information be? Should the response be broken up into various sections? And most importantly, who is the writer that GPT is pretending to be? A helpful school teacher, a prolific journalist, or an esteemed researcher? Each of them would write differently for each target audience. After a few weeks of fiddling around, this is what I came up with for each length.

## Generate Demo

After my script downloaded 12 versions of each Wikipedia article and saved them to my local machine, one final script took all the outputs from all the articles and merged them into one large file that is used in the demo.

This way if I want to add or replace articles, I can just regenerate the full demo automatically.

Click here to see the **[Readability Demo](/posts/readability-demo)**.

If you want to see different versions of any specific Wikipedia article, please [let me know](https://chir.ag/contact.shtml).
